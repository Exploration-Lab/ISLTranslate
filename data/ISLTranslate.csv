d5d9a14756d5-36,The more I thought about what I had seen
d5d9a14756d5-37,The more afraid I became.
d5d9a14756d5-38,I thought it could be one of the savages of the mainland who had wandered out to the sea in a small boat.
d5d9a14756d5-40,"Luckily, I was not on shore at that time. But what if?"
d5d9a14756d5-41,he had seen my boat?
d5d9a14756d5-42,"If he had seen the boat, he would have realised that someone lived on the island."
d5d9a14756d5-43,and would soon return with others.
d5d9a14756d5-44,to kill and eat me.
d5d9a14756d5-45,And so I lay fearful for many days and prayed for protection.
d5d9a14756d5-46,"In doing so, I was much comforted."
d5d9a14756d5-47,and began going out to investigate.
d5d9a14756d5-48,"but even now, as I went forward"
d5d9a14756d5-49,I looked behind me frequently.
d5d9a14756d5-50,Because I was still very frightened. However...
d5d9a14756d5-51,as I went about for two or three days and saw nothing.
d5d9a14756d5-52,I became a little bolder.
d5d9a14756d5-53,I decided to go down to the shore again and examine the footprint once more.
d5d9a14756d5-54,I decided to measure it with my own footmark.
d5d9a14756d5-55,As I came closer to the footprint
d5d9a14756d5-56,I realized that it could not be my footprint because I had not come to this part of the beach since a long time.
d5d9a14756d5-57,"Secondly, as I placed my foot alongside that footprint, it seemed larger than my own."
d5d9a14756d5-58,My fear returned. I went home again.

58131855adfb-2,"Unit 2, Teacher's Pages"
58131855adfb-3,Unit 2 is an opportunity to share with children feelings that we can all be happy being what we are.
58131855adfb-5,Little children feel joyous when they are told how good they are.
58131855adfb-6,So use this unit to make every child of your class feel special.
58131855adfb-7,Share this verse with the class after the activity. So what if they are dark or fair?
58131855adfb-9,So what if they are tall or small?
58131855adfb-10,So what if they are this or that? They are your children.
58131855adfb-11,and you love them for what they are.
58131855adfb-12,This is the thought that needs to be nurtured.
58131855adfb-13,"The movements, actions, activities of different animals or birds can be discussed."
58131855adfb-15,Poems in their mother-tongues can be recited.
58131855adfb-16,Develop listening skills
58131855adfb-17,"In this unit, involve the children in playing"
58131855adfb-18,a silence game.
58131855adfb-19,Let them all be gently guided to listen.
58131855adfb-20,Do the sounds of the fan rustling of leaves.
58131855adfb-21,Imagine how the wind makes a noise or what the leaves are saying.
58131855adfb-22,and then speak what they listen to or imagined.
58131855adfb-23,The focus is to develop in children the habit of listening.
58131855adfb-25,"During the morning assembly, practice rhymes with actions."
58131855adfb-26,"If possible, practice of sargam, music or breathing exercises too can be introduced."
58131855adfb-27,Develop Vocabulary.

58131855adfb-32,in a ribus form
58131855adfb-33,that is words plus pictures.
58131855adfb-34,The children should be introduced to more collective nouns. For example
58131855adfb-35,an army of ants.
58131855adfb-36,A bunch of flowers.
58131855adfb-37,More exercises are to be given on punctuation.
58131855adfb-39,Give children more practice by introducing new words for making plurals.
58131855adfb-40,page 38
58131855adfb-41,Exposure to language
58131855adfb-42,Let children build words related to what they like about their friends. As for example...
58131855adfb-43,Sunil is so tall.
58131855adfb-44,Rahim is really good. Keep adding names of children.
58131855adfb-45,and then have a class activity for the same. Here is a table given below.
58131855adfb-46,for names of students and what they like about others. However
58131855adfb-47,Now it is time to expose children to listen to two or more sounds to make words more systematically.
58131855adfb-48,As for example
58131855adfb-49,"When we bring A and T together, we make a family of"
58131855adfb-50,At words.
58131855adfb-51,"After making the concept clear in their minds, we can show them how to make three letter words with at. For example"
58131855adfb-52,"A class game of making new words with at, for example"
58131855adfb-53,bat
58131855adfb-54,cat
58131855adfb-55,fat rat
58131855adfb-56,Can now be continued.

58131855adfb-74,Develop writing skills.
58131855adfb-75,Units 1 and 2 are opportunity to revise the writing skills of Book 1.
58131855adfb-76,This is also a time for children to listen to words pronounced by the teacher. As in apple.
58131855adfb-77,and create pictures which can then lead them to sentence formation.
58131855adfb-78,Develop the ability to follow directions. Top.

58131855adfb-80,"Have the children describe what they see in the top, middle and bottom shelf of a school cupboard."
58131855adfb-81,"If you do not have a cupboard, let the class be involved in drawing or making one with a cardboard box."

1f1bb4e3121b-9,at the foothills of the Katskill mountain
1f1bb4e3121b-10,was a little village.
1f1bb4e3121b-11,"In the village lived a simple, good-natured fellow named Rip Van Winkle."

1f1bb4e3121b-14,The children of the village shouted with joy whenever they saw him.
1f1bb4e3121b-15,Because he played with them.
1f1bb4e3121b-16,He taught them to fly kites.
1f1bb4e3121b-17,and shoot marbles.
1f1bb4e3121b-18,and told them long stories.
1f1bb4e3121b-19,The only problem with Rip was that he was very lazy.
1f1bb4e3121b-20,He did no work on his own farm and just idled away his time.
1f1bb4e3121b-21,His fences were falling to pieces.
1f1bb4e3121b-22,His cow was going astray.

1f1bb4e3121b-29,It was late in the afternoon when he reached there.
1f1bb4e3121b-30,"Tired after his long climb, he lay down and began daydreaming."
1f1bb4e3121b-31,It was soon evening and he realised it would be night by the time he reached his village.
1f1bb4e3121b-32,page 84

1f1bb4e3121b-37,"RIP van Winkle! He looked around and saw a short old man with thick hair and a grizzled beard, walking to watch him with a barrel."
1f1bb4e3121b-38,"He made signs to help him carry the barrel, rip hurried to help the stranger who caught his hand tightly."
1f1bb4e3121b-39,Together they reached a place where there were some more odd-looking men playing ninepins.
1f1bb4e3121b-40,"They were all dressed the same way, and all of them had beards of various shapes and colors."
1f1bb4e3121b-41,"Even though they were playing a game, their faces were serious and there was silence."
1f1bb4e3121b-42,page 86
1f1bb4e3121b-43,"The only sound was the noise of the balls, which echoed in the mountains like thunder."
1f1bb4e3121b-44,As Rip and his companion reached them
1f1bb4e3121b-45,They stopped playing and stared at rip.
1f1bb4e3121b-46,with a fixed gaze.
1f1bb4e3121b-47,Rip was really frightened. His companion emptied the contents of the barrel into glasses and made Rip drink it.
1f1bb4e3121b-48,Rip obeyed as he was trembling with fear.
1f1bb4e3121b-49,"Since he was thirsty, he drank a few more glasses and slowly fell into a deep sleep."
1f1bb4e3121b-50,On waking up he found that he was at the place where he had first met the old man.
1f1bb4e3121b-51,He rubbed his eyes.
1f1bb4e3121b-52,It was a bright sunny morning.
1f1bb4e3121b-53,Surely I have not slept here all night.
1f1bb4e3121b-54,thought rip

1f1bb4e3121b-58,He then shouted.
1f1bb4e3121b-59,No dog was to be seen. Where has this dog gone? He murdered to himself.
1f1bb4e3121b-60,He began to descend the mountain to go back to his village.
1f1bb4e3121b-61,Page 86.
1f1bb4e3121b-62,Has he neared the village?
1f1bb4e3121b-63,he met a number of people.
1f1bb4e3121b-64,But he didn't know any of them.
1f1bb4e3121b-65,The villagers all so stared at him equally surprised.
1f1bb4e3121b-66,Who is this man? said one.
1f1bb4e3121b-67,I have never seen him before.
1f1bb4e3121b-68,said another

1f1bb4e3121b-70,and his wrinkled face. On hearing.
1f1bb4e3121b-71,This rip stroked his chin.
1f1bb4e3121b-72,"And to his astonishment, he found his beard had grown a foot long, and it was all white."
1f1bb4e3121b-73,An old woman walked up to him and looked at his face for a moment.
1f1bb4e3121b-74,Then she exclaimed.
1f1bb4e3121b-75,It is Rip Van Winkle!
1f1bb4e3121b-76,"Welcome home again, old neighbour. Where have you been these 20 long years?"

60c9973b69ed-2,A Little Fish Story
60c9973b69ed-3,There are a great many million fish in the seas.
60c9973b69ed-4,"But this story is about just one of them, and a very small one at that. Now this little fish had everything in the seas to make him contented. But..."
60c9973b69ed-5,He was not happy. You will laugh...
60c9973b69ed-6,when I tell you why he was not.
60c9973b69ed-7,He was unhappy because he was so very small.
60c9973b69ed-8,It is very hard to be such a little might of a fish.
60c9973b69ed-9,"He would say, over and over again."
60c9973b69ed-10,"If I were only larger, how much happier I could be?"
60c9973b69ed-11,And he said it so many times that I think he believed it.
60c9973b69ed-12,One day he was swimming along with the rest of his school and thinking.
60c9973b69ed-13,"No doubt, how much more the larger fish had to be thankful for than he?"
60c9973b69ed-14,"When suddenly, with no warning, they found themselves in the meshes of a great net."
60c9973b69ed-15,There was much floundering and splashing as the net was drawn up out of the water into the sunlight.
60c9973b69ed-16,"and just as its hull was being emptied into the boat, the smallest fish in the school wriggled through the mesh and slipped back into the cool clear water."
60c9973b69ed-17,How good it felt!
60c9973b69ed-18,"He swam here and there and everywhere, and some of the fish who knew him well, all the rest of his life said that they never again."

9b0136913690-40,It was you who ordered me to come. So I will not quit your house till I have shaved you.
9b0136913690-41,He then began narrating another story which lasted half an hour.
9b0136913690-42,Stop making your fine speeches and let me go quickly!
9b0136913690-43,I have an affair of the greatest importance!
9b0136913690-44,I have to go out at noon!
9b0136913690-45,said the Sultan.
9b0136913690-46,Page 102.
9b0136913690-47,"When he saw that the Sultan was really angry with him,"
9b0136913690-48,"The barber said, Oh Master, do not be angry, I will begin to shave you. Saying this."
9b0136913690-49,He washed the sultans head and began to shave.
9b0136913690-50,But he had not touched him even four times with the razor when he stopped.
9b0136913690-51,"And said, My Master, you are acting hastily in this matter."
9b0136913690-52,Go on shaving me! Speak no more!
9b0136913690-53,"order the Sultan, be patient. said the barber."
9b0136913690-54,Perhaps you have not considered well what you were going to do.
9b0136913690-55,I wish you would tell me what this matter of great importance is all about.
9b0136913690-56,And then I will give you my opinion on it.
9b0136913690-57,Finish shaving at once! The Sultana exclaimed.
9b0136913690-58,But instead of doing this
9b0136913690-59,The Barber left the Sultan half-shaped.
9b0136913690-60,to go and see what time it was.
9b0136913690-61,My patience is exhausted!
9b0136913690-62,The Sultan cried.
9b0136913690-63,"Be calm, my master. And you shall be shaved in a moment. said the Barber"
9b0136913690-64,"And saying this, he continued shaving the sultan."
9b0136913690-65,But while he was doing this...
9b0136913690-66,He could not help talking.
9b0136913690-67,If you could inform me what this
9b0136913690-68,Important affair is I would give more advice which you might find useful. he said.
9b0136913690-69,The sultan was completely fed up by now and decided to satisfy the Barber.
9b0136913690-70,He told him that he was giving a feast.
9b0136913690-71,"to some friends at noon, which was why he was in a hurry to leave."
9b0136913690-72,"When the Barber heard the Sothan mention of feast, he exclaimed, that reminds me."
9b0136913690-73,"Yesterday I invited four or five friends to come to my house today, but I had quite forgotten it."
9b0136913690-74,and have not made any preparations for them.
9b0136913690-75,The Sultan who was at the mercy of the Barber was ready to do anything to be rid of him.
9b0136913690-76,Be quick and finish your work!
9b0136913690-77,"The Sultan replied, and you shall have all the food that has been prepared for me today."
9b0136913690-78,Please show me the food so that I may judge if it is enough for my five friends.
9b0136913690-79,I have enough food for you! The Sultan exclaimed
9b0136913690-80,But he ordered that all the food prepared for his feast be...
9b0136913690-81,brought in.
9b0136913690-82,The barber looked over the food and said
9b0136913690-83,This is very good but I shall want some fruit for the dessert also.
9b0136913690-85,The sultan in desperation since his head was half shaved ordered that the fruits should also be brought in.
9b0136913690-86,Page 105
9b0136913690-87,The Barber left off shaving the sultan to examine each dish separately. This took up half an hour.
9b0136913690-88,The sultans stamped his feet impatiently.
9b0136913690-89,But the Barber did not hurry.
9b0136913690-90,"At length, however, he again took up the razor."
9b0136913690-91,"But after a few minutes of work, stopped suddenly and cried."
9b0136913690-92,I never knew that you were...

b005df5e411b-92,Some mice were playing hide and seek near him.
b005df5e411b-94,One mouse got trapped under the lion's paw. The lion woke up.

b005df5e411b-100,You are a true friend!
b005df5e411b-101,said the lion.

3a6cfc943757-2,The Little Bully
3a6cfc943757-3,Do you know of any child who teases others or push them around?
3a6cfc943757-4,What would you call such a child?
3a6cfc943757-5,Read this story and see how hari a little boy troubles other children.
3a6cfc943757-6,"Once upon a time, not so very long ago, there was a small boy called Hari."
3a6cfc943757-7,"Although he wasn't very big, he was strong and he loved to tease all the boys and girls."
3a6cfc943757-8,Who went to school with him?
3a6cfc943757-9,What he loved to do most was to pinch.
3a6cfc943757-10,He could make a big bruise appear in half a second.
3a6cfc943757-11,Another trick he played was pricking people with a pin.
3a6cfc943757-12,"So, you can guess how all the children hated him. They tried pinching him back."
3a6cfc943757-13,But that was no good.
3a6cfc943757-14,because he could always pinch harder. They didn't like telling their teacher.
3a6cfc943757-15,because that was telling tales.
3a6cfc943757-16,It so happened that the class went for a picnic.
3a6cfc943757-17,to the seaside for a whole day.
3a6cfc943757-18,All the children were most excited.
3a6cfc943757-19,page 136. Take advantage if you stand that day.
3a6cfc943757-20,The sun shone bright.
3a6cfc943757-21,and all the children were wild with excitement.
3a6cfc943757-22,"They crowded into the train and sat down, but nobody wanted to sit next to hari."
3a6cfc943757-23,because he always pinched.
3a6cfc943757-24,"When they arrived at the seaside, out jumped all the children."
3a6cfc943757-25,with a shout of joy.
3a6cfc943757-26,"Down to the sands, they raced. Hand in hand."
3a6cfc943757-27,But nobody took Harri's hand.
3a6cfc943757-28,Nobody went near him. Hari was angry. He went to a sandy corner near a rocky pool and sat down by himself.
3a6cfc943757-29,"It took out his lunch and looked at it. It was a good lunch. There were two hard boiled eggs, six jam sandwiches, three pieces of bread and butter, a ginger cake,"
3a6cfc943757-30,and a bar of chocolate.
3a6cfc943757-31,He would eat it all by himself.
3a6cfc943757-32,He wouldn't offer anything to anyone.
3a6cfc943757-33,Page 137.
3a6cfc943757-34,"Just as he was beginning on the eggs, he heard a horse voice near him."
3a6cfc943757-35,Good morning. I am so pleased to meet a boy like you.
3a6cfc943757-36,Hari turned around.
3a6cfc943757-37,and stared in fright.
3a6cfc943757-38,Whatever do you think he saw?
3a6cfc943757-39,Hari saw a monster crab walking sideways out of the pool.
3a6cfc943757-40,"His eyes were on the ends of short stalks, and he looked most queer."
3a6cfc943757-41,"He held out his front claw to hurry. Hurry put out his hand to shake the crab's claw, but to his surprise and anger the crab opened his pincers and nipped his hand so hard."
3a6cfc943757-42,That the little boy yelled.
3a6cfc943757-43,"Ah, here is my good cousin. Set the crab pleasantly."
3a6cfc943757-44,"And to Hari's horror, he saw a large sandy lobster crawling heavily out of the pool. Before the little boy could stop him, the lobster."
3a6cfc943757-45,took his hand in his great pincer like claws and pinched it so hard that hurry yelled in pain.
3a6cfc943757-46,Page 138.
3a6cfc943757-47,"Then he stared at the pool in surprise, for out came sandy coloured shrimps and prawns. More crabs."
3a6cfc943757-48,"and another large lobster, and they pricked hurry till he was soon black and blue with their pinching."
3a6cfc943757-49,Don't you like it?
3a6cfc943757-50,said all the creatures in surprise.
3a6cfc943757-51,"Why? We were told you would love to see us, because you were a champion pincher and pricker yourself"
3a6cfc943757-52,come come join in the fun
3a6cfc943757-54,"hari leapt to his feet, crying loudly."
3a6cfc943757-55,His lunch rolled into the pool.
3a6cfc943757-56,"And when the crabs and lobsters saw it, they ran to it and began to feast eagerly."
3a6cfc943757-57,Hari saw that they had forgotten him for a time. And he dawned and ran for his life.
3a6cfc943757-58,Tears screaming down his cheeks!
3a6cfc943757-59,They only did to me.
3a6cfc943757-60,What I keep doing to the other children. He thought. But how he thought? And...
3a6cfc943757-61,And how I hated those crabs and lobsters!
3a6cfc943757-62,I suppose the other children hate me too.
3a6cfc943757-63,"Well, I jolly well shant pinch."

0726445c45f9-30,I see! said mother.

0726445c45f9-38,"Yes, yes, we'll remove all your things from the room and lock the door on the outside."
0726445c45f9-39,"So the house will be perfectly safe and papa and mama's parrots can come and go freely too. Just think Nina, while you enjoy yourself at the wedding, the baby's parrots will be getting nice and fat in their nest. Good idea, isn't it?"
0726445c45f9-40,It was a good idea.
0726445c45f9-41,"When Nina came back from the wedding, there were two plumb little sparrows flying all over the room and wasn't Nina thrilled."

29e7bf42fd88-67,"11 to 11 pm, other subjects and then..."
29e7bf42fd88-68,To bed!
29e7bf42fd88-69,Huh? But when is the time to play?
29e7bf42fd88-70,"Play? What is the need, Munna? Oh!"
29e7bf42fd88-71,I love the green fields bhaiya
29e7bf42fd88-72,the gentle breeze. I want to jump up.
29e7bf42fd88-73,Like a football. I like the touch and go and hu tu tu sounds of the kabaddi. The hurry and flurry of volleyball pulls me like a magnet.
29e7bf42fd88-74,"As soon as I'm on the field, I forget everything!"
29e7bf42fd88-75,Scene 3
29e7bf42fd88-76,The final exams are over and the results are out.
29e7bf42fd88-77,"Alas, I have failed once again!"
29e7bf42fd88-78,Ohhh..
29e7bf42fd88-79,But Brother I have passed and topped my class!
29e7bf42fd88-80,Now there is only two years difference between us.
29e7bf42fd88-81,"But my dear brother, don't be so proud."
29e7bf42fd88-82,You have passed only one class and you think that I am stupid?
29e7bf42fd88-83,And you are smart.
29e7bf42fd88-84,"Once in a while, in a gulidanda game, you might get lucky and hit a goal."
29e7bf42fd88-85,But that does not mean...
29e7bf42fd88-86,You have mastered the game.
29e7bf42fd88-87,Page 68.
29e7bf42fd88-88,You have to work hard to be successful in life.
29e7bf42fd88-89,"When you have to study a subject like algebra or geometry in higher classes,"
29e7bf42fd88-90,Then you will understand the importance of hard work.
29e7bf42fd88-91,"In geometry, if one writes..."
29e7bf42fd88-92,ACB instead of ABC.
29e7bf42fd88-93,The answer is marked wrong.
29e7bf42fd88-94,The examiners will not spare you.
29e7bf42fd88-95,They want you to learn word by word from the text books.
29e7bf42fd88-96,"Oh, Bhai Sahab"
29e7bf42fd88-97,This is scary!
29e7bf42fd88-98,"I don't think I want to go to the ninth class now, but I will still complete my day's homework."
29e7bf42fd88-99,So that I get no punishment in class.
29e7bf42fd88-100,Just today we were asked to write a short essay on the topic of punctuality.
29e7bf42fd88-101,in 4 pages.
29e7bf42fd88-102,"And imagine, can something be written on four pages and still be short?"
29e7bf42fd88-103,It's all so mixed up.
29e7bf42fd88-104,Thank God it was time for school or else the scolding would have gone on and on.
29e7bf42fd88-105,Scene 4
29e7bf42fd88-106,The results were out once again.
29e7bf42fd88-107,And it so happened that Munna passed.
29e7bf42fd88-108,and Bhaiya failed again.
29e7bf42fd88-109,Bhiaya was really upset. Munna was also sad seeing his brother so unhappy.
29e7bf42fd88-110,Baya now becomes gentler with Munna.
29e7bf42fd88-111,Munna became naughtier because of this and studied even less than before.
29e7bf42fd88-113,"Ah, I'm lucky!"
29e7bf42fd88-114,I can pass easily. I need not study so hard.
29e7bf42fd88-115,Now I can play games with my friends and fly kites!
29e7bf42fd88-116,But I should still be careful that Bhaiya does not see me flying kites. One day
29e7bf42fd88-117,a kite is flying slowly downwards.
29e7bf42fd88-118,"Munna starts running in order to grab it. Suddenly, he comes face to face with Bhaiya."
29e7bf42fd88-119,Page 69.
29e7bf42fd88-120,Ah! Ah! Oh!
29e7bf42fd88-121,Aren't you ashamed to be flying kite all day long?
29e7bf42fd88-122,Don't you realize that now you are in the 8th class?
29e7bf42fd88-123,And are not studying in a lower class.
29e7bf42fd88-124,If you think that I am just one class ahead of you and I can't say anything...
29e7bf42fd88-125,You are wrong!
29e7bf42fd88-126,I am 5 years older than you are and will always be.
29e7bf42fd88-127,Understanding doesn't come only from reading books.
29e7bf42fd88-128,Look at Ma and Baba
29e7bf42fd88-129,Ma has never gone to school.
29e7bf42fd88-130,and Baba has only passed fifth class.
29e7bf42fd88-131,"Really, Bhaiya? Is that true?"
29e7bf42fd88-132,Page 70
29e7bf42fd88-133,Yes!
29e7bf42fd88-134,There are a thousand things that they know more than you or me
29e7bf42fd88-135,"And even if we have studied the wisdom of the whole world, Ma and Baba will always have the right to explain to us and correct us. ."
29e7bf42fd88-136,"Now, what would you do if I were to fall sick today?"
29e7bf42fd88-137,"I don't know, Bhaiya."
29e7bf42fd88-138,I would tell Baba and He would rush to the hostel.
29e7bf42fd88-139,Aha! I had expected this answer. Now Baba would not get upset.
29e7bf42fd88-140,He would first try to find out what was wrong and then he would call a doctor.
29e7bf42fd88-141,Baba would know exactly what to do.
29e7bf42fd88-142,They have more experience than us.
29e7bf42fd88-143,"Bhaiya, I'm sorry. What you say is true."
29e7bf42fd88-144,I also like to play and fly kites.
29e7bf42fd88-145,"But if I also play, then how can I watch out for you?"
29e7bf42fd88-146,You are my responsibility. I love you Bhaiya.
29e7bf42fd88-147,New words

b43a1342f8f5-68,Oliver was a nine year old boy.
b43a1342f8f5-69,He lived with other homeless boys in an orphanage.
b43a1342f8f5-70,He was pale and thin as were the other boys living there.
b43a1342f8f5-71,"This was because they had to work hard, but were never given enough to eat."
b43a1342f8f5-72,"The owner of the orphanage, Mr. Bumble,"
b43a1342f8f5-73,"was a cruel man, and he ill-treated the boys."
b43a1342f8f5-74,The boys were always hungry. It was true that they were given three meals a day.
b43a1342f8f5-75,But each meal consisted only of a bowl of watery soup.
b43a1342f8f5-77,They were almost starving. So it was decided by them to ask the master for more soup. But who would bell the cat?
b43a1342f8f5-78,"Finally, the task fell to Oliver."
b43a1342f8f5-79,"When all the boys had assembled in the cold stone hall for their evening meal,"
b43a1342f8f5-80,The soup was served.
b43a1342f8f5-81,It soon disappeared.
b43a1342f8f5-82,The boys whispered to one another.
b43a1342f8f5-83,and one boy pushed Oliver a little.
b43a1342f8f5-84,"Oliver, making a brave effort stood up, walked up to the master with his bowl and spoon in his hand, and said, tremblingly."

b43a1342f8f5-92,Then why were they always hungry?

GIx57eZ4R0M--41,Safai Karamcharis collect the garbage in trucks and take it to a low lying open area called a landfill.
GIx57eZ4R0M--42,Figure 16.2
GIx57eZ4R0M--43," There, the part of the garbage that can be reused is separated out from the one that cannot be used as such. Figure 16.1 shows a landfill."
GIx57eZ4R0M--44,Page 157
GIx57eZ4R0M--45," Thus, the garbage has both useful and non-useful components."
GIx57eZ4R0M--46,The non-useful component is separated out. It is then spread over the landfill and then covered with the layer of soil.
GIx57eZ4R0M--47,once the landfill is completely full.
GIx57eZ4R0M--48,It is usually converted into apart or a playground. For the next 20 years or so...
GIx57eZ4R0M--49,no building is constructed on it.
GIx57eZ4R0M--50,to deal with some of the useful components of garbage.
GIx57eZ4R0M--51,Composed making areas are developed near the landfill.
GIx57eZ4R0M--52,What is composed?
GIx57eZ4R0M--53,Let us learn about it from the following activity.
GIx57eZ4R0M--54,Pahili did wonder.
GIx57eZ4R0M--55,as to what could be useful garbage?
GIx57eZ4R0M--56,Why was it thrown away in the first place?
GIx57eZ4R0M--57,Is there some garbage that is not actually garbage?
GIx57eZ4R0M--58,Activity 1.
GIx57eZ4R0M--59,Collect the garbage from your house before it is thrown into the dustbin.
GIx57eZ4R0M--60,Separate it into two groups so that they have
GIx57eZ4R0M--61,Group 2
GIx57eZ4R0M--62,Gabbage from the kitchen
GIx57eZ4R0M--63,like fruit and vegetables peels.
GIx57eZ4R0M--64,eggshells
GIx57eZ4R0M--65," waste food, tea leaves"
GIx57eZ4R0M--66," include newspapers,"
GIx57eZ4R0M--67,dry leaves
GIx57eZ4R0M--68,and paper bags in this group.
GIx57eZ4R0M--69,Group 3
GIx57eZ4R0M--70,pieces of cloth
GIx57eZ4R0M--71,Broken glass
GIx57eZ4R0M--72,polyteen bags
GIx57eZ4R0M--73,Aluminium wrappers
GIx57eZ4R0M--74,Nails
GIx57eZ4R0M--75,All shoes.
GIx57eZ4R0M--76,and broken toys.
GIx57eZ4R0M--77,Now divide the contents of each group into two separate heaps.
GIx57eZ4R0M--78," Label them as A, B, C and D."
GIx57eZ4R0M--79,Put one heap from group one and one heap from group two into two separate plastic bags.
GIx57eZ4R0M--80,Tie the mouth of these two backs tightly.
GIx57eZ4R0M--81,Put all the four heaps in separate pits and cover them with soil.
GIx57eZ4R0M--82,Figure 16.3
GIx57eZ4R0M--83,You can also use 4 pots to bury these garbage heaps.
GIx57eZ4R0M--84,Remove the soil after 4 days and observe the changes in the garbage.
GIx57eZ4R0M--85,A black color and no foul smell indicates that rotting of garbage is complete.
GIx57eZ4R0M--86,Put the heaps again in the pits and cover with the soil.
GIx57eZ4R0M--87,Observe again after every two days and note your observations as suggested.
GIx57eZ4R0M--88,did the garbage 1
GIx57eZ4R0M--89,Rot completely and not smell. 3
GIx57eZ4R0M--90,Rot only partially. Free election of consultation with humanity
GIx57eZ4R0M--91,Rot almost completely but still smells bad. 5
GIx57eZ4R0M--92,not change at all
GIx57eZ4R0M--93,Garbage in which heap was seen to rot and which did not. User
GIx57eZ4R0M--94," 1, 2, 3 or 4 in the columns of table 16.1 based on your observations."
GIx57eZ4R0M--95,Figger 16.2 Shows
GIx57eZ4R0M--96,Putting garbage heaps in pits.
GIx57eZ4R0M--97,Page 158
GIx57eZ4R0M--98," If you make any other observations,"
GIx57eZ4R0M--99,Do not forget to write all these down in your notebook.
GIx57eZ4R0M--100,Thank you.
GIx57eZ4R0M--101,Do not remove and burn the garbage that did not rot.
GIx57eZ4R0M--102,table 16.2
GIx57eZ4R0M--103,What has happened to the garbage heaps?
GIx57eZ4R0M--104,There are 5 columns. 1 is for garbage heap heap A heap B heap C heap D.
GIx57eZ4R0M--105," 2nd is for after 4 days, 3rd column is for after 6 days, 4th column is for after 2 weeks and 5th column is for after 4 weeks"
GIx57eZ4R0M--106,Now complete this table according to your observation as suggested.
GIx57eZ4R0M--107,If the garbage was found to rot completely and did not smell.
GIx57eZ4R0M--108,Mix it in the soil where you sow your favorite plants. This would be...
GIx57eZ4R0M--109,provide nutrients to the plants.
GIx57eZ4R0M--110,You must have observed from this activity that some things in the garbage rot.
GIx57eZ4R0M--111,they form manure which is used for the plants
GIx57eZ4R0M--112,The rotting and conversion of some materials into manual is called composting.
GIx57eZ4R0M--113,in some cities and towns.
GIx57eZ4R0M--114,Municipalities provide separate dust bins.
GIx57eZ4R0M--115,for collecting two kinds of garbage.
GIx57eZ4R0M--116,Usually one is colored blue.
GIx57eZ4R0M--117,and the other is green.
GIx57eZ4R0M--118,The blue bin is for materials that can be used again.
GIx57eZ4R0M--119," such as plastics, metals,"
GIx57eZ4R0M--120,and glass.
GIx57eZ4R0M--121,Did you notice that these are the materials that do not rot in the garbage heaps?
GIx57eZ4R0M--122,The green bins are for collecting kitchen and other plant or animal waste.
GIx57eZ4R0M--123,You may have noticed that this type of wastes rot completely when buried in the soil.
GIx57eZ4R0M--124,Do you see why it is necessary for us to separate waste into two groups as we did in Activity 1 before we throw it?
GIx57eZ4R0M--125,Have you noticed Garpage heaps of dried leaves on the roadside?
GIx57eZ4R0M--126,Most of the time these are burnt.
GIx57eZ4R0M--127," Farmers too often burn the husk, dried leaves and part of crop plants in their fields after harvesting."
GIx57eZ4R0M--128,Burning of these produces smoke and gases that are harmful to our health. HSPR
GIx57eZ4R0M--129,try to stop such practices.
GIx57eZ4R0M--130,These weights could be converted into useful compost.
GIx57eZ4R0M--131," Here is the figure given, figure 16.3 shows burning of leaves produce harmful gases."
GIx57eZ4R0M--132,Here are some of the observations and thoughts noted by Paheli and Bhujo.
GIx57eZ4R0M--133," from their project, dealing with garbage."
GIx57eZ4R0M--134,Boto noted in his notebook.
GIx57eZ4R0M--135,Do not burn leaves.
GIx57eZ4R0M--136,You will not be able to tolerate the fumes.
GIx57eZ4R0M--137,Page 159
GIx57eZ4R0M--138,Pahili made a note in her notebook.
GIx57eZ4R0M--139,Why has the government not made burning of leaves a theft?
GIx57eZ4R0M--140,not have really.
GIx57eZ4R0M--141,She must have meant illegal.
GIx57eZ4R0M--142,She wanted that the government should make a law against the burning of leaves and other plant wastes anywhere in India. 16.3
GIx57eZ4R0M--143,Varmi Composting
GIx57eZ4R0M--144,We can be friends of plants by supplying them with...
GIx57eZ4R0M--145,composed.
GIx57eZ4R0M--146,We will also be very good friends to ourselves by making compost.
GIx57eZ4R0M--147," Talking of friends, do you know that earthworms are called farmer's friend?"
GIx57eZ4R0M--148,Let us find out.
GIx57eZ4R0M--149,How a type of earthworm called
GIx57eZ4R0M--150,Red worm is used for composting.
GIx57eZ4R0M--151,This method of preparing compost with the help of red worms is called Vormi Composting.
GIx57eZ4R0M--152,We can try to make manual by vermic composting at school.
GIx57eZ4R0M--153,Activity 3
GIx57eZ4R0M--154,Let us dig up it about 30 cm deep.
GIx57eZ4R0M--155,or keep a wooden box at a place.
GIx57eZ4R0M--156,which is neither too hot nor too cold.
GIx57eZ4R0M--157,What about a place which does not get direct sunlight?
GIx57eZ4R0M--158,Let us now make a comfortable home for our red worms.
GIx57eZ4R0M--159,in the pit or the box.
GIx57eZ4R0M--160,Spread a net or chicken mash at the bottom of.
GIx57eZ4R0M--161,the bit.
GIx57eZ4R0M--162,or the box.
GIx57eZ4R0M--163,You can also spread 1 or 2 cm thick layer of sand as an alternative.
GIx57eZ4R0M--164,Now spread some more vegetable wastes including peels of fruits over this layer of sand.
GIx57eZ4R0M--165,One can also use green leaves.
GIx57eZ4R0M--166,Pieces of dried stalks of plants
GIx57eZ4R0M--167,Hask or Pieces of Newspaper or Cardboard
GIx57eZ4R0M--168,To spread cover the layer of sand.
GIx57eZ4R0M--169," However, shiny or plastic coated paper should not be used for this purpose."
GIx57eZ4R0M--170,Dryed animal dung could also be used as a spread over sand.
GIx57eZ4R0M--171,or wire mesh.
GIx57eZ4R0M--172,Sprinkle some water to make this layer wet.
GIx57eZ4R0M--173,take care not to use excess of water.
GIx57eZ4R0M--174,Do not press the layer of waste.
GIx57eZ4R0M--175,Keep this layer loose so that it has sufficient air and moisture.
GIx57eZ4R0M--176,Now your pit is ready to welcome the red bombs.
GIx57eZ4R0M--177,Buy some red worms and put them in your pit.
GIx57eZ4R0M--178,Cover them loosely with a gunny bag or an old sheet of cloth.
GIx57eZ4R0M--179,or a layer of grass.
GIx57eZ4R0M--180,FIGURE 16.5
GIx57eZ4R0M--181," Here is the figure given, figure 16.4 which shows red worms."
GIx57eZ4R0M--182,Your red worms need food. You can give them vegetable and fruit wastes.
GIx57eZ4R0M--183,Coffee and tea remains.
GIx57eZ4R0M--184,and weeds from the fields or
GIx57eZ4R0M--185,Garden
GIx57eZ4R0M--186,Figure 16.5.
GIx57eZ4R0M--187,It might be a good idea to bury this Ford about.
GIx57eZ4R0M--188,3 to 3 cm inside the pit.
GIx57eZ4R0M--189,Page 159.
GIx57eZ4R0M--190,Do not use Ways.
GIx57eZ4R0M--191," that may contain salt, pickles, oil."
GIx57eZ4R0M--192,vinegar meat
GIx57eZ4R0M--193,and milk preparations as food.
GIx57eZ4R0M--194,for your red worms.
GIx57eZ4R0M--195," If you put these things in the pit, disease causing small organisms start growing in the pit."
GIx57eZ4R0M--196,once in a few days.
GIx57eZ4R0M--197,gently mix and move the top layers of your pit.
GIx57eZ4R0M--198,Red worms do not have teeth
GIx57eZ4R0M--199,They have a structure called Gizard which helps
GIx57eZ4R0M--200,them in grinding their food.
GIx57eZ4R0M--201,Powdered egg shells or sea shells could be mixed with the wastes.
GIx57eZ4R0M--202,This would help red worms in grinding their food.
GIx57eZ4R0M--203,A right bomb can eat food equal to its own weight in a day.
GIx57eZ4R0M--204,Red worms do not survive in very hot or very cold surroundings.
GIx57eZ4R0M--205,They also need moisture around them.
GIx57eZ4R0M--206," If you take good care of your worms,"
GIx57eZ4R0M--207,In a month time their number will be double.
GIx57eZ4R0M--208,Observe the contents of the pit carefully after 3-4 weeks.
GIx57eZ4R0M--209,Do you now see loose soil-like material in the pit?
GIx57eZ4R0M--210,Your vermicompost is ready.
GIx57eZ4R0M--211,Figure 16.7
GIx57eZ4R0M--212,Put some wastes as food in one corner of the pit.
GIx57eZ4R0M--213,Most of the worms will shift towards this part of the pit.
GIx57eZ4R0M--214,vacating the other part.
GIx57eZ4R0M--215,Remove the compost from the vacated part and dry it in the sun for a few hours.
GIx57eZ4R0M--216,Your Vermi Compost is ready for use.
GIx57eZ4R0M--217,The part left in the pit has most of the worms in it.
GIx57eZ4R0M--218,You can use these for preparing more compost.
GIx57eZ4R0M--219,or share them with another user.
GIx57eZ4R0M--220,Figure 16.5 Shows
GIx57eZ4R0M--221,foot for red worms.
GIx57eZ4R0M--222," Here is the figure given, figure 16.6."
GIx57eZ4R0M--223,shows where we composting.
GIx57eZ4R0M--224,Use this excellent vermi compost in your...
GIx57eZ4R0M--225,boards.
GIx57eZ4R0M--226,Gardens
GIx57eZ4R0M--227,or feels.
GIx57eZ4R0M--228,Is this not like getting the best out of waste?
GIx57eZ4R0M--229,Those of you who have agricultural fields can try vermicomposting in large pits.
GIx57eZ4R0M--230,You can save a lot of money that is spent on buying
GIx57eZ4R0M--231,Expensive chemical fertilizers and manure from the market.

yzP6HD0Zr3Y--4,the synopsis
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--5,for the first part.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--6,Saida mother has not received proper medical.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--7,treatment for her complaints.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--8,She has denied healthy food.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--9,sunshine and fresh air.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--10,At last.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--11,She consults a good physician.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--12,who gives her effective medicine.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--13,and sound advice. Now the list.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--14,"Saida's mother had been ailing for a long time. Fever, Cough"
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--15," Body ache, painful joints"
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--16,and what not.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--17,Treated by a variety of physicians for weeks.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--18,She often showed signs of improvement.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--19,But soon relapsed into her old sick self.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--20,one complaint substituted by another.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--21," Though weak and colourless, she was forbidden normal food."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--22," and was understood orders to remain perpetually confined to her small, dingy room, with doors and windows, fastened, deprived of sunshine and fresh air."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--23," page number 29. When she became critical,"
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--24,Her relatives and neighbors persuaded her to consult a specialist.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--25,even though his fee was likely to be high.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--27,Life is more precious than money.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--28," This said, SaIda's mother was poor."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--29,but she heeded their advice and
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--30, Sold a few tinkets to pay the doctor's fee.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--31,and the cost of medicine.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--32,The doctor came in a few days
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--33,and examined her and prescribed effective but costly medicine.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--34,To the question as to what she should eat
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--35," He said,"
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--36," Anything you wish to eat? Chapati, vegetables, milk"
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--37," fruits, etc. In addition to all this,"
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--38," He added emphatically, leave this dark hovel."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--39,and occupy a bigger room with doors and windows open.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--40,Sit in the sun every morning from 8 to 9.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--41,sunshine and fresh air. He concluded are more important than medicine.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--42,The doctor and his advice became a subject of noisy commentary among all present. Some favored while others opposed it.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--43,Exposure to sun and air for someone afflicted with chronic cough was dangerous an experienced lady declared
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--44,A younger neighbour
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--45,nearly quarreled with her over this
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--46,Too exhausted two participate in the debate Saida's mother remained quiet.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--47,but determined to follow the doctor's advice.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--48,Forget the consequences she said at last.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--49,I'll carry out his instructions to the letter.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--50,Move my bed into the next room and let me sit in the sun on my charpoi for an hour daily. Now the synopsis.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--51,for the next spot.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--52,The sky remains overcast with clouds for a few days.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--54,Saida makes a special request to the sun rays.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--55,to help her mother get well.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--56,The sun rays keep their word.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--57,come down in large numbers.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--58,and give new life to Saida's mother.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--59,page number 31
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--60,Now the next part
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--61,It so happened that the sky remained overcast next morning.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--62,The same was the case the following day.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--63,Saida's mother was rejected.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--64," She muttered, O Lord of mine, why have you ordered the Son to remain hidden?"
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--65,How will I ever be cured?
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--66,Saida was playing with her doll nearby.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--67,and she heard her mother's lament.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--68,but kept calm.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--69,Later in the afternoon.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--70,when she stumbled on a spot of pale sunshine in the courtyard.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--71,She ran to her mother to say the sun was there.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--72," No, no, said everybody present."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--73,It's too late and chilly.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--74,Your mother can't sit out there. Disheartened.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--75,say the return to her doll.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--76,There was no sun really except for its last remnant entangled in the top branches of the family mango tree.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--77,Now children have at their command a secret language.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--78," foreign to grown-ups altogether, in which they fluently communicate with trees."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--79," flowers, animals."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--80,the Sun and the Moon.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--81,perhaps even with the almighty.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--82," Using that special language, say the addressed her remark to the last departing ray of the sun."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--83,Dearest Sister
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--84,Do come tomorrow with lots of warmth and brightness.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--85," You see, my mother is ill."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--86,and needs your help.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--87," Surely, answered the light."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--88,Don't look unhappy. We'll be here at the fixed hour.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--89," Next day, early in the morning, when the sprightly sun rays embellished themselves for their journey down to earth, the sun..."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--90,said.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--91," It's our day again. We are staying up here. The road to earth is blocked by an army of thick, mucky clouds."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--92,The little rays so much wanted to go down for a log.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--93,but they remained quiet
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--94," One of them, though, who had made a pact with little Saeedar said, S Tax,"
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--95,I can't stay back.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--96," I have given my word to Saeedah, whose mother is ill and needs our help."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--97,I'll pierce through the clouds to reach Saida's courtyard.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--99,Page number 31.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--100,How else will her mother be cured.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--101," Hearing this, all the rays nearly staged a revolt against their father, the Sun."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--102,Fancy staying back again.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--103,They are said in a single voice.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--104,What will the people of the earth say about us?
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--105,that we of the heavens have turned lies?
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--106,the Sun Relented.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--107," Please, yourselves."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--108," He said, mind your clothes, though the clouds are mucky."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--109,Never mind our clothes.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--110," We can always change, but go we must. And the rays"
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--111,rushed towards the earth.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--112,The clouds stood guard between them and Saeeda's courtyard.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--113,The little rays focused their heat and they had enough of it on a battalion of clouds.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--114,which had to flee from its post. The rays got through
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--115," Shooting pass the bewildered clouds, they were all ready late."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--117,Page number 32.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--118,Seida saw the whole host of them approaching and her heart leapt with joy.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--119," She shouted, Amma, amma, the sun is here, come out"
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--120,The old lady's eyes welled up with tears of gratitude.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--121,Her charpoi was placed in the courtyard and she sat on it for an hour.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--122,reclining against bolsters. It had been months since she had felt the sun on her hands and face.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--123,and breathed in fresh air. She thought.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--124,She was in a new world.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--125,"Though pale, her face glowed"
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--126,and her eyes shone bright.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--127," She saw her child too, bathed in sunlight."
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--128,and kissed her.
yzP6HD0Zr3Y--129,The morning air brought in a new fragrance from nearby flowers.

tRdqPGHDEvM--4,page 99
tRdqPGHDEvM--5,This page has a series of pictures.
tRdqPGHDEvM--6,where Isha and her friend are talking to each other.
tRdqPGHDEvM--7," The friend tells Isha, Isha Yur skirt is beautiful. To which Isha replies,"
tRdqPGHDEvM--8,My mother made this pattern. The friend says...
tRdqPGHDEvM--9,I have seen the same block.
tRdqPGHDEvM--10,making a different pattern on a curta.
tRdqPGHDEvM--11," Isha says, how was it different?"
tRdqPGHDEvM--12,The friend explains.
tRdqPGHDEvM--13," In your skirt, the rule of the pattern is..."
tRdqPGHDEvM--14," 1 up, 1 down."
tRdqPGHDEvM--15,Then this is repeated. But in my brother's kurtaa...
tRdqPGHDEvM--17," It is once up, then takes a one-fourth turn every time."
tRdqPGHDEvM--18,The rule is to repeat it with a 1-4th clockwise turn.
tRdqPGHDEvM--19," The friend has just explained. One up, one down, and then..."
tRdqPGHDEvM--20,one sub and then a one fourth turn clockwise.
tRdqPGHDEvM--21,Now you use these two rules to make patterns with this block.
tRdqPGHDEvM--22,There is a block as a flower on leaves shown in the form of a small picture.
tRdqPGHDEvM--23,Also make your own rule.

tRdqPGHDEvM--36,We have a block with us with...
tRdqPGHDEvM--37,magenta-colour on a couple of green leaves.
tRdqPGHDEvM--38,Observe this blog. We make three different rules to turn it clocked.
tRdqPGHDEvM--39," Likewise, and see the patterns."
tRdqPGHDEvM--40,Rule 1
tRdqPGHDEvM--41,Repeat it with a 1-4th turn.
tRdqPGHDEvM--42,There is a series of pictures below this.
tRdqPGHDEvM--43,Indicating how this one fourth turn repeat takes place.
tRdqPGHDEvM--44,Rule 2
tRdqPGHDEvM--45,Repeat it with a half turn.
tRdqPGHDEvM--46,Below this again we have a series of pictures indicating this half turn repeat.
tRdqPGHDEvM--48,Rule 3
tRdqPGHDEvM--49,Repeat it with the 3-4th turn.
tRdqPGHDEvM--50,And again we have a series of pictures.

hM959_pXlrE--1,for class 6 Entitled
hM959_pXlrE--2,Science 1.
hM959_pXlrE--3,This is the lesson 13.
hM959_pXlrE--4,Titled
hM959_pXlrE--5,fun with magnets
hM959_pXlrE--6,Page 125
hM959_pXlrE--7,Paheli and Bhoojo went to a place where a lot of waste material was piled into huge heaps.
hM959_pXlrE--8,Something exciting was happening.
hM959_pXlrE--9,A crane was moving towards the heap of junk. The long hand of the crane lowered a block over a heap.
hM959_pXlrE--10,It then began to move.
hM959_pXlrE--11,Guess what?
hM959_pXlrE--12,Many pieces of iron junk were sticking to the block.
hM959_pXlrE--13,as it moved away.
hM959_pXlrE--14,Figure 13.1 They had just...
hM959_pXlrE--15,a read a very interesting book on magnets.
hM959_pXlrE--16,And knew immediately that there must be a magnet attached to the end of the crane that was picking up iron from the junkyard.
hM959_pXlrE--17,You might have seen magnets and have even enjoyed playing with them.
hM959_pXlrE--18,Have you seen stickers that remain attached to iron surfaces like al miras or the doors of refrigerators?
hM959_pXlrE--19," In some pin holders, the pins"
hM959_pXlrE--20,Seen to be sticking to the holder.
hM959_pXlrE--21,In some pencil boxes?
hM959_pXlrE--22,The lid fits tightly when we close it even without a locking arrangement.
hM959_pXlrE--23," Such stickers, pin holders and pencil boxes have magnets fitted inside."
hM959_pXlrE--24,Figure 13.2
hM959_pXlrE--25," If you have any one of these items, try to locate the magnets hidden in these."
hM959_pXlrE--26,Figure 13.1 shows.
hM959_pXlrE--27,Picking up pieces of iron from waste by a crane. Figure 13.2 shows us...
hM959_pXlrE--28," some common items that have magnets inside them like refrigerator, pencil box and pin holder."
hM959_pXlrE--29,How magnets were discovered? It is said that there was a shepherd.
hM959_pXlrE--30,named Magnus who lived in ancient Greece.
hM959_pXlrE--31,He used to take his herd of sheep and goats to the nearby mountains for grazing.
hM959_pXlrE--32,He would take a stick with him to control his hurt. The stick had a small piece of iron attached at one end.
hM959_pXlrE--33,One day he was surprised to find that he had to pull hard to free his stick from a rock on the mountain side.
hM959_pXlrE--34,Figure 13.3
hM959_pXlrE--35,Page 126
hM959_pXlrE--36,It seemed as if the stick was being attracted by the rock.
hM959_pXlrE--37,The rock was a natural magnet and it attracted the iron tip of the shepherd's stick.
hM959_pXlrE--38,It is said that this is how natural magnets was discovered.
hM959_pXlrE--39,Such rocks were given the name Magnetite.
hM959_pXlrE--40,Perhaps after the name of that shepherd.
hM959_pXlrE--41,Magnetite contains iron.
hM959_pXlrE--42,Some people believe that magnetite was first discovered at a place called Magnesia.
hM959_pXlrE--43,The substances having the property of attracting iron are now known as magnets.
hM959_pXlrE--44,This is how the story goes.
hM959_pXlrE--45," In any case, people now have discovered that certain rocks..."
hM959_pXlrE--46,have the property of attracting pieces of iron.
hM959_pXlrE--47,They also found that small pieces of these rocks have some special properties.
hM959_pXlrE--48,They named these naturally occurring materials magnets.
hM959_pXlrE--49," Later on, the process of making magnets from pieces of iron was discovered."
hM959_pXlrE--50,These are known as artificial magnets.
hM959_pXlrE--51," Nowadays artificial magnets are prepared in different shapes. For example,"
hM959_pXlrE--52,BAR MAGNET
hM959_pXlrE--53,horse shoe magnet.
hM959_pXlrE--54,cylindrical or a ball ended magnet
hM959_pXlrE--55,Figure 13.4 shows a few such magnets.
hM959_pXlrE--56,Activity 1
hM959_pXlrE--57,Tika Plastic or a Paper Cup
hM959_pXlrE--58,Fix it on a stand.
hM959_pXlrE--59,with the help of a clamp as shown in figure 13.5.
hM959_pXlrE--60,Place a magnet inside the cup.
hM959_pXlrE--61,and cover it with a paper so that the magnet is not visible.
hM959_pXlrE--62,Attach a thread to a clip made of iron.
hM959_pXlrE--63,Fix the other end of the thread at the base of the stand.
hM959_pXlrE--64," Mind you, the trick involved here is to keep the length of the thread sufficiently short."
hM959_pXlrE--65,Bring the clip near the base of the cup.
hM959_pXlrE--66,The clip is raised in air without support. Like a guide.
hM959_pXlrE--67,Figure 13.5 shows effect of magnet a paper clip hanging in air.
hM959_pXlrE--68,Page 127
hM959_pXlrE--69,13.1 Magnetic and Non-Magnetic Materials
hM959_pXlrE--70,Activity 2
hM959_pXlrE--71,Let us walk in the footsteps of Magnus.
hM959_pXlrE--72,Only this time we will change the positions of the magnet and the iron.
hM959_pXlrE--73,There will be a magnet at the end of our shepherds stick.
hM959_pXlrE--74," We can attach a small magnet to a hawk stick, walking stick or a cricket wicket with a tape or some glue."
hM959_pXlrE--75,Let us now go out on a Magnus Walk.
hM959_pXlrE--76,through the school playground.
hM959_pXlrE--77,What does our Magnistic pick up from the school ground?
hM959_pXlrE--78,What about objects in the classroom?
hM959_pXlrE--79,Collect various objects of day-to-day use from your surroundings. Test these with the Magnus stick.
hM959_pXlrE--80," You can also take a magnet, touch these objects with it and observe which objects stick."
hM959_pXlrE--81,to the magnet.
hM959_pXlrE--82,Prepare a table in your notebook.
hM959_pXlrE--83,As shown in table 13.1 and record your observations.
hM959_pXlrE--84,Look at the last column of table 13.
hM959_pXlrE--85,one and note the objects that are attracted by a magnet.
hM959_pXlrE--86," Now, make a list of materials from which these objects are made."
hM959_pXlrE--87,Is there any material common in all the objects that were attracted by the magnet?
hM959_pXlrE--88,We understand that magnet attracts...
hM959_pXlrE--89," Certain materials, whereas some do not get attracted towards magnet."
hM959_pXlrE--90,The materials which get attracted towards a magnet are magnetic. For
hM959_pXlrE--91,Iron
hM959_pXlrE--92,Nickel
hM959_pXlrE--94,The materials which are not attracted towards the magnet are non-magnetic.
hM959_pXlrE--95,What materials did you find to be non-magnetic from table 13.1?
hM959_pXlrE--96,is soil a magnetic or a non-magnetic material.
hM959_pXlrE--97,Bhoojho has this question for you?
hM959_pXlrE--98,A tailor was stitching buttons on his shirt.
hM959_pXlrE--99,The needle has slipped from his hand onto the floor.
hM959_pXlrE--100,Can you help the tailor to find the needle?
hM959_pXlrE--101," Figure 13.1, finding the objects attracted by magnet."
hM959_pXlrE--102,The table is divided into three columns. One is for Name of the object.
hM959_pXlrE--103,Second is for material which the object is made of.
hM959_pXlrE--104," like, cloth"
hM959_pXlrE--105,platic
hM959_pXlrE--106,aluminium
hM959_pXlrE--107,water
hM959_pXlrE--108,Glass
hM959_pXlrE--109,Iron 
hM959_pXlrE--110,or any other.
hM959_pXlrE--111,The third one is for attracted by Magnus Stick Magnet.
hM959_pXlrE--112,You
hM959_pXlrE--113,Yes or no? 1
hM959_pXlrE--114,Iron ball which is made up of iron.
hM959_pXlrE--115," Yes, it is attracted. Second is scale."
hM959_pXlrE--116,which is made up of plastic.
hM959_pXlrE--117," No, it is not attracted by Magnistic."
hM959_pXlrE--118," 3rd is shoe, which is made up of"
hM959_pXlrE--119,Leder
hM959_pXlrE--120,Complete this table according to your observation.
hM959_pXlrE--122,Page 128
hM959_pXlrE--123,Activity 3
hM959_pXlrE--124,Rub a magnet in the sand or soil.
hM959_pXlrE--125,Pull out the magnet.
hM959_pXlrE--126,Are there some particles of sand or soil sticking to the magnet?
hM959_pXlrE--127,Now gently shake the magnet to remove the particles of sand or soil.
hM959_pXlrE--128,Are some particles still sticking to it?
hM959_pXlrE--129,These might be small pieces of iron or iron fillings picked up from the soil.
hM959_pXlrE--130," Through such an activity, we can find out whether the soil or sand from a given place contains particles that have iron."
hM959_pXlrE--131,try this activity near you home!
hM959_pXlrE--132,school or the places you visit on your holidays
hM959_pXlrE--133,Does the magnet with R and fillings sticking to it?
hM959_pXlrE--134,Look like anyone of those shown in figure 13.6.
hM959_pXlrE--136,Make a table of what you find.
hM959_pXlrE--137," Table 13.2, Magnet rubbed in sand. How many iron fillings?"
hM959_pXlrE--138,Here is a small table which is divided into two columns.
hM959_pXlrE--139," Name of location, colony and town, or city or village."
hM959_pXlrE--140," And the second one is for, did you find iron fillings sticking to the magnet? Many? Very few or none? Complete this table according to your observation. If you fill this table and send it to Paheli and Bojhoo, they can compare the amount of iron fillings found in soil from different parts of the country."
hM959_pXlrE--141,13.2 Poles of Magnet
hM959_pXlrE--142," We observed that iron fillings, if they are present, stick to a magnet rubbed in the soil."
hM959_pXlrE--143,Did you observe anything special about the way they stick to the magnet?
hM959_pXlrE--144,Activity 4
hM959_pXlrE--145,Spread some iron fillings on a sheet of paper.
hM959_pXlrE--146,Now place a bar magnet on this sheet. What do you observe?
hM959_pXlrE--147,Do the Iron fillings stick all over the magnet?
hM959_pXlrE--148,Do you observe that more iron fillings get attracted to some parts of the magnet than others?
hM959_pXlrE--149,Figure 13.7
hM959_pXlrE--150,Remove the iron fillings sticking to the magnet and repeat the activity.
hM959_pXlrE--151,Do you observe any change in the pattern with which the iron fillings get attracted by different parts of the magnet?
hM959_pXlrE--152,You can do this activity using pins.
hM959_pXlrE--153,or iron nails in place of iron fillings.
hM959_pXlrE--154,and also with magnets of different shapes.
hM959_pXlrE--155,Draw a diagram to show the way our in fillings stick to the magnet.
hM959_pXlrE--156,is your drawing similar to that shown in figure.
hM959_pXlrE--157,13.6A
hM959_pXlrE--158,We find that most of the iron fillings are attracted towards the two ends of a bar magnet.
hM959_pXlrE--159,Page 129
hM959_pXlrE--160,These ends are the poles of the magnet.
hM959_pXlrE--161,Try and bring a few magnets of different shapes to the classroom.
hM959_pXlrE--162,Check for the location of the poles on these magnets using iron fillings.
hM959_pXlrE--163,Can you now mark the location of poles in the kind of magnets shown in figure 13.4?
hM959_pXlrE--164,Paheli has this puzzle for you.
hM959_pXlrE--165,You are given two identical bars which look as if they might be made of iron.
hM959_pXlrE--166,One of them is a magnet while the other is a simple iron bar.
hM959_pXlrE--167,How will you find out which one is a magnet?

TYbsjtUmRmQ--19,Siddhartha also known as
TYbsjtUmRmQ--20," Gautama, the founder of Buddhism,"
TYbsjtUmRmQ--21,was born about 2500 years ago.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--22,This was a time of rapid change.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--23,in the lives of people.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--24,as you saw in chapter 5.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--25,Some kings in the Mahajan padas were growing more powerful.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--26,New cities were developing
TYbsjtUmRmQ--27,and life was changing in the villages as well.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--28,See Chapter 9
TYbsjtUmRmQ--29,Many thinkers were trying to understand these changes in society.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--30,They also wanted to try and find out
TYbsjtUmRmQ--31,the true meaning of life.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--32,the Buddha belonged to a small Gana.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--33," known as, the Sakya gana."
TYbsjtUmRmQ--34,and was a kshatriya. When he was a young man.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--35,He left the comforts of his home in search of knowledge.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--36,He wandered for several years.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--37,meeting and holding discussions with other thinkers.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--38,He finally decided to find his own path of realization.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--39,and meditated for days on end.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--40,under a people tree at Bodh Gaya.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--41," in Bihar, where he attained"
TYbsjtUmRmQ--42," Enlightenment. After that,"
TYbsjtUmRmQ--43,he was known as the Buddha or the Wise One.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--44,He then went to Sarnath.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--46,Near Varanasi
TYbsjtUmRmQ--47,where he taught for the first time.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--48,He spent the rest of his life traveling on foot.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--50," going from place to place, teaching people."
TYbsjtUmRmQ--51,till he passed away at Kusinara
TYbsjtUmRmQ--52," page number 58., The Buddha taught"
TYbsjtUmRmQ--53,that life is full of suffering.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--54,and unhappiness. This is caused because...
TYbsjtUmRmQ--55,We have cravings and desires.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--56," which often cannot be fulfilled. If you want to make a light, just add a little more force to"
TYbsjtUmRmQ--57,even if we get what we want.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--59,We are not satisfied.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--60,and we want even more.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--61,or want other things.

TYbsjtUmRmQ--101,Kisargothami was overjoyed and started off at once.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--102," Buddha, gently stopped her."
TYbsjtUmRmQ--103,and added.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--104,The seeds must come from the house of a family.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--105,where nobody has died.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--106,"Kisagotami, went from door to door. But wherever she went..."

TYbsjtUmRmQ--114,schools of Indian philosophy.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--115,Over centuries India's intellectual exploration of truth has come to be represented by the six systems of philosophy.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--116,These are known as...

TYbsjtUmRmQ--134,These philosophies still guide scholarly discourse in the country. German born
TYbsjtUmRmQ--135,British Indologist
TYbsjtUmRmQ--136,Frederich Max Muller has observed.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--137,that the six systems of philosophy were developed over many generations.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--138,with contributions made by...

TYbsjtUmRmQ--142,Upanishads
TYbsjtUmRmQ--143,around the time that the Buddha was preaching and perhaps a little earlier.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--144,Other thinkers also try to find answers to difficult questions.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--145,Some of them wanted to know about life after death.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--146,Others want it to know why sacrifices.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--147,should be performed.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--148,Many of these thinkers felt that there was something permanent in the universe.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--149,that would last even after death.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--150,they describe this as the Atma.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--151,or the individual soul.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--152,and the Brahma or...
TYbsjtUmRmQ--153,the universal soul
TYbsjtUmRmQ--154,They believed that ultimately both the Atma and the Brahma
TYbsjtUmRmQ--155,were one.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--156,Many of their ideas were recorded in Upanishads.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--157,These were part of the later Vedic texts.

TYbsjtUmRmQ--165,The Wise Beggar
TYbsjtUmRmQ--166,Here is a dialogue based on a story.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--167,from one of the most famous Upanishads. The Chhandogya.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--168,Upanishads
TYbsjtUmRmQ--169,Shaunaka and Abhipratarin.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--170,were two sages who worshipped.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--171,"the universal soul. Once,"
TYbsjtUmRmQ--172,as they sat down to eat.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--173,a beggar came and asked for some food.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--174,We cannot spare anything for you.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--175,Shaunka said
TYbsjtUmRmQ--176,"Learned, sirs."
TYbsjtUmRmQ--177,whom do you worship?
TYbsjtUmRmQ--178,The beggar asked The universal soul
TYbsjtUmRmQ--179,Abhi Prataran replied.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--180,It means...
TYbsjtUmRmQ--181,that you know that the universal soul fills the entire world.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--182," Yes, yes, we know that."
TYbsjtUmRmQ--183,the sages nodded.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--184,If the universal soul fills the whole world.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--185,It fills me too. Who am I?
TYbsjtUmRmQ--186," but a part of the world, the beggar."
TYbsjtUmRmQ--187,Asked.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--188,You speak the truth.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--189,O young Brahmin. Then.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--190," O sages, by not giving me food."
TYbsjtUmRmQ--191,you are actually denying food to the Universal Soul.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--192,The sages realized the truth of what the beggars said and shared their food with him.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--194,How did the beggar convince the sages to share their food with him?
TYbsjtUmRmQ--196,Most Upanishadik thinkers were men. Specially
TYbsjtUmRmQ--197,Brahmin's and Rajas.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--198," Occasionally, there's a mention of women thinkers such as Gargi."
TYbsjtUmRmQ--200,who was famous for her learning.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--201,and participated in debates held in royal courts.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--203,who are people rarely took part in these discussions.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--204,One famous exception was Satyakam Jabal.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--205," who was named after his mother, the slave woman."
TYbsjtUmRmQ--206,Jabali
TYbsjtUmRmQ--207,He had a deep desire to learn about reality. He was accepted.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--208,as a student by a Brahmin teacher named...
TYbsjtUmRmQ--209,Gautama
TYbsjtUmRmQ--210,and became one of the best known thinkers of the time.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--212,Many of the ideas of the Upanishads were later developed by the famous thinker.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--213,"Shankar Acharya , About whom"
TYbsjtUmRmQ--214," You will read in class 7. In a phone call, you will think the right phone is exactly your null date, or whether you"

TYbsjtUmRmQ--218,This was also the time when other scholars
TYbsjtUmRmQ--219,were at work
TYbsjtUmRmQ--220,One of the most famous was Panini
TYbsjtUmRmQ--221,who prepared the  grammer för sankrit.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--222,He arranged the vowels and consonants in a special order.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--223,and then used these to create formula.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--224,like those found in algebra.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--225,He used these to write down the rules of the language in short formula.
TYbsjtUmRmQ--226,around 3000 of them.

dJ_5m1Y2InE--6, How long is this pencil? guess
dJ_5m1Y2InE--7,dash centimeters measure it using a scale
dJ_5m1Y2InE--8,How good is your guess?
dJ_5m1Y2InE--10,We can see that Anju used a lens. To make it look bigger.
dJ_5m1Y2InE--12," Given below is a picture of Anju, thinking and talking to herself."
dJ_5m1Y2InE--13,It is more than 3 cm.
dJ_5m1Y2InE--15,Here one centimeter has ten equal parts.
dJ_5m1Y2InE--16," So, each part is one tenth of a centimeter."
dJ_5m1Y2InE--17,one 10th of a cm is called 1 mm.
dJ_5m1Y2InE--18,This knowledge is given to us by one of the flies passing by.
dJ_5m1Y2InE--20,and that same fly then sits on the scale
dJ_5m1Y2InE--21,and tells us when we look at it through the lens.
dJ_5m1Y2InE--22," See, I am 3mm long."
dJ_5m1Y2InE--23," Meanwhile, Anju now realizes that the pencil is how long."
dJ_5m1Y2InE--25," Oh, so this pencil is?"
dJ_5m1Y2InE--26,3 cm and 6 mm long
dJ_5m1Y2InE--27,And this time we see a little bigger fly on the scale.
dJ_5m1Y2InE--28,Telling us.
dJ_5m1Y2InE--29,But I am longer.
dJ_5m1Y2InE--30,7 10th of a centimeter or millimeters.
dJ_5m1Y2InE--32,We also call one tenth of a centimeter as

vekaTiI1qjw--3,for the first part of this story.
vekaTiI1qjw--4," A poor shepherd once lived in Iran. Though uneducated,"
vekaTiI1qjw--5,He was very wise and helpful.
vekaTiI1qjw--6,The king decided to meet him in disguise. Now the story
vekaTiI1qjw--7,in a village in Iran.
vekaTiI1qjw--8,Their ones lived a shepherd. He was very poor.
vekaTiI1qjw--9,He did not have even a small cottage of his own.
vekaTiI1qjw--10,He had never been to school or learned to read and write.
vekaTiI1qjw--11,for their very few schools in those days.
vekaTiI1qjw--12,the poor and uneducated.
vekaTiI1qjw--13,This shepherd was very wise.
vekaTiI1qjw--14,He understood people's sorrows and troubles and helped them phase their problems with courage and common sense.
vekaTiI1qjw--15,Many people came to him for advice.
vekaTiI1qjw--16,Soon he became famous for his wisdom and friendly nature.
vekaTiI1qjw--17,The king of that country heard about him and thought of meeting him.
vekaTiI1qjw--18," disguised as a shepherd and riding on a mule, one day the king came to the cave where the wise."
vekaTiI1qjw--19,Shepherd Lift.
vekaTiI1qjw--20,page number 8.
vekaTiI1qjw--21,As soon as the shephard saw the traveler coming towards the cave.
vekaTiI1qjw--22,He rose to welcome him.
vekaTiI1qjw--23," He took the tired traveller inside the cave, gave him water to drink, and a share of his own meager meal."
vekaTiI1qjw--24,The king rested for the night in the cave and was greatly impressed by the Shephard's hospitality and wise conversation.
vekaTiI1qjw--25,Now the synopsis of the next part of the story.
vekaTiI1qjw--26,The Shepherd was able to make out that his visitor was none other than the King.
vekaTiI1qjw--27,The king made the wise shepherd governor of a small district.
vekaTiI1qjw--28,Other governors became jealous of the new governor and called him dishonest.
vekaTiI1qjw--29," Though still tired, the king decided to depart the next morning. He said,"
vekaTiI1qjw--30,Many thanks for your kindness to a poor traveler.
vekaTiI1qjw--31,I have a long way to go.
vekaTiI1qjw--32,Permit me to leave.
vekaTiI1qjw--33," Looking straight into the eyes of the guest, the shepherd replied,"
vekaTiI1qjw--34," Thank you, Your Majesty."
vekaTiI1qjw--35,for paying me the compliment of a visit.
vekaTiI1qjw--36,The king was astonished as well as pleased.
vekaTiI1qjw--37," He is indeed very wise, he thought to himself."
vekaTiI1qjw--38,I need people like him to work for me.
vekaTiI1qjw--39," and the king appointed this humble shepherd, the governor of a small district."
vekaTiI1qjw--40,although he rose to power and dignity.
vekaTiI1qjw--41,The shepherd remained as humble as ever.
vekaTiI1qjw--42," people loved and honoured him for his wisdom, sympathy and goodness. He was..."
vekaTiI1qjw--43,kind and just to one and all.
vekaTiI1qjw--44,His fame as a fair and wise governor soon spread throughout the country.
vekaTiI1qjw--45,Now the governors of other provinces grew terribly jealous of him and began to talk to the king against him. They said...
vekaTiI1qjw--46,He is very dishonest and keeps for himself part of the money that he...
vekaTiI1qjw--47,collected as tax from the people.
vekaTiI1qjw--48,Why did he always carry with him?
vekaTiI1qjw--49,the added and iron chest.
vekaTiI1qjw--50,Perhaps he carried in it the treasure.
vekaTiI1qjw--51,that he had secretly collected.
vekaTiI1qjw--52," After all, they said mockingly."
vekaTiI1qjw--53,He was an ordinary shepherd and could behave no better. Page number 9.
vekaTiI1qjw--55,Now the synopsis of the next part of the story.
vekaTiI1qjw--56,The new governor was called to the palace.
vekaTiI1qjw--57,He was ordered to explain why he always carried an iron chest.
vekaTiI1qjw--58,They just contained no gold or silver.
vekaTiI1qjw--59,Now the next part of this story.
vekaTiI1qjw--60," At first, the king did not pay attention to these reports, but how long could he ignore these governors and their endless stories about the Shepherd?"
vekaTiI1qjw--61," One thing was certain, the king discovered. The new governor did carry an iron chest with him all the time."
vekaTiI1qjw--62," So, one day the new governor was summoned to the palace."
vekaTiI1qjw--63,He came riding on his camel.
vekaTiI1qjw--64," Enter everyone's delight. The famous iron chest was there, fastened securely behind him on the camel's back."
vekaTiI1qjw--65,Now the king was angry. He thundered.
vekaTiI1qjw--66,Why do you always carry that ironchesst with you?
vekaTiI1qjw--67,What does it contain?
vekaTiI1qjw--68,The Governor smiled.
vekaTiI1qjw--69,He asked his servant to bring in the chest.
vekaTiI1qjw--70,How eagerly the people standing around waited for the shepherd to be found out.
vekaTiI1qjw--71,but how great was their astonishment and even of the king himself when the chest was opened.
vekaTiI1qjw--72," No gold or silver, or jewels."
vekaTiI1qjw--73,But an old blanket was all that came out.
vekaTiI1qjw--74,Page number 10 Holding it up.
vekaTiI1qjw--75,proudly the shepherds said. This my dear master is my only treasure.
vekaTiI1qjw--76,I always carry it with me.
vekaTiI1qjw--77,But why do you carry such an ordinary blanket with you?
vekaTiI1qjw--78,Surely you are the governor of a district.
vekaTiI1qjw--79,The King asked.
vekaTiI1qjw--80,to which the shepherd replied with quiet dignity.
vekaTiI1qjw--81,this blanket
vekaTiI1qjw--82,He's my oldest friend.
vekaTiI1qjw--83,It will still protect me if at any time your Majesty.
vekaTiI1qjw--84,should wish to take away my new cloaks.
vekaTiI1qjw--85,How pleased the King was. And how embarrassed the jealous governors became to hear the wise man's reply. Now...
vekaTiI1qjw--86,they knew that the Shepherd was indeed
vekaTiI1qjw--87,the humblest and the wisest man in the land.
vekaTiI1qjw--88,The king made him the governor of a much bigger district.
vekaTiI1qjw--89,that very day.

HjIQyD6G2Rg--81,Observe the motion of the stone.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--82,We see that the stone moves along a circular path.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--83," In this motion, the distance of the stone from your hand remains the same."
HjIQyD6G2Rg--84,This type of motion is called circular motion.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--85,Figure 10.13 A B C shows some objects in circular motion.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--87,The motion of a point marked on the blade of an electric fan.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--88,Or the hands of a clock are examples of circular motion.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--89,as shown in figure 10.13. The Electric Fan or the Clock.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--90,by themselves are not moving from one place to another.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--91,But the blades of the fan rotate and so do the hands of a clock.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--92,Page 104
HjIQyD6G2Rg--93,If we mark a point anywhere on the blades of a fan or on the hands of a clock.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--94,The distance of this point from the center of the fan or the clock will remain the same as they rotate.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--95,In some cases an object repeats its motion after some time.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--96,This type of motion is called periodic motion.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--97,Take the stone tied with a string that you used in Activity 7.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--98,Now hold the string in your hand and let the stone hang from it.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--99,This is a pendulum.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--100,Pull the stone to one side with the other hand and let it go.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--101,Now the pendulum is in motion.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--102,It is an example of periodic motion.

HjIQyD6G2Rg--106,are all examples of periodic motion where an object or a part of it repeats its motion after a fixed interval of...
HjIQyD6G2Rg--107,time.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--108,Figure 10.14
HjIQyD6G2Rg--109,Figure 10.14 shows examples of periodic motion.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--110,Did you observe a sewing machine as a part of Activity 5?
HjIQyD6G2Rg--111,You must have observed that it remains at the same location while any point on its wheel moves with a circular motion.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--112,It also has a needle that moves up and down continuously.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--113," As long as the wheel rotates, isn't it?"
HjIQyD6G2Rg--114,This needle is undergoing a periodic motion.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--115,Have you observed closely the motion of a ball along the ground?
HjIQyD6G2Rg--116,Bujo is not sure why we say that the distance of the stone from your hand is the same when we whirl it around.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--117,Can you help him understand this?
HjIQyD6G2Rg--118,Remember that the stone is held with a string.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--119,Page 105
HjIQyD6G2Rg--120,Here the ball is rolling on the ground.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--121,rotating as well as moving forward along the ground.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--122," Thus, the ball undergoes a rectilinear motion as well as rotational motion."
HjIQyD6G2Rg--123,Can you think of other examples where objects undergo combinations of different types of motion?
HjIQyD6G2Rg--124,We did many measurement activities and discussed some kinds of motion.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--125,We saw that motion is a change in the position of an object with time.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--126,The change in this position can be determined through distance measurements.
HjIQyD6G2Rg--127,This allows us to know how fast or slow motion is.

ijrjSBx7WTc--43,She jumped to the conclusion that it was her son's blood.
ijrjSBx7WTc--44,and the mongoose was the guilty one.
ijrjSBx7WTc--46,The farmer's wife finished her shopping and came back home.
ijrjSBx7WTc--47,with a basket full of groceries.
ijrjSBx7WTc--48,She saw the mongoose sitting outside as if waiting for her.
ijrjSBx7WTc--49," On seeing her, he ran to welcome her."
ijrjSBx7WTc--50,as was customary.
ijrjSBx7WTc--51,The farmer's wife took one look at the mongoose and screamed.
ijrjSBx7WTc--52,Blood! She cried!
ijrjSBx7WTc--53,The face and paws of the mongoose were smeared with blood.
ijrjSBx7WTc--54,You wicked animal! You have killed my baby!
ijrjSBx7WTc--55,She screamed hysterically.
ijrjSBx7WTc--56,She was blind with rage and with all her strength brought down the heavy basket full of groceries.
ijrjSBx7WTc--57,On the blood-spir mongoose and ran inside to the child's cradle.
ijrjSBx7WTc--58,page number six.
ijrjSBx7WTc--59,The baby was fast asleep.
ijrjSBx7WTc--60,But on the floor lay a black snake torn and bleeding. In a flash.
ijrjSBx7WTc--61,She realized what had happened. She ran out looking for the mongoose
ijrjSBx7WTc--62," Oh, you saved my child."
ijrjSBx7WTc--63,You kill the snake.
ijrjSBx7WTc--64,What have I done? She cried.
ijrjSBx7WTc--65,touching the mongoose who lay dead and still.
ijrjSBx7WTc--66,Unaware of her sobbing. The farmer's wife.
ijrjSBx7WTc--67," who had acted hastily and rashly, stared long at the dead mongoose."
ijrjSBx7WTc--68,Then she heard the baby crying.
ijrjSBx7WTc--69,wiping her tears she went in to feed him.
ijrjSBx7WTc--70,This is a story from the Panchatantra.
ijrjSBx7WTc--71,Now the questions.
ijrjSBx7WTc--72,Question number one
ijrjSBx7WTc--73,Why did the farmer bring a baby mongoose into the house?
ijrjSBx7WTc--74,Question number two.
ijrjSBx7WTc--75,Why didn't the farmer's wife want to leave the baby alone with the mongoose?
ijrjSBx7WTc--76,Question number 3
ijrjSBx7WTc--77,What was the farmer's comment on his wife's fears?
ijrjSBx7WTc--78,Question Number 4
ijrjSBx7WTc--79,Why did the farmer's wife strike the mongoose with her basket?
ijrjSBx7WTc--80,Question number five. Did she repent her hasty action?
ijrjSBx7WTc--81,How does she show her repentance?
ijrjSBx7WTc--82," Do you have a pet, a cat or a dog?"
ijrjSBx7WTc--83," If not, would you like one?"
ijrjSBx7WTc--84,How would you look after it?
ijrjSBx7WTc--85,Are you for or against keeping birds in a cage as pets?
e0DLg40lww8--1,Fixed joints.
e0DLg40lww8--2,Some joints between bones in our head are different from those we have discussed so far.
e0DLg40lww8--3,The bones cannot move at these joints.
e0DLg40lww8--4,Such joints are called fixed joints.
e0DLg40lww8--5," When you open your mouth wide, you can move your lower jaw away from your head, isn't it?"
e0DLg40lww8--6,Try to move your upper jaw now.
e0DLg40lww8--7,Are you able to move it?
e0DLg40lww8--8,There is a joint between the upper jaw and the rest of the head which is a fixed joint.
e0DLg40lww8--9,We discussed only some of the joints that
e0DLg40lww8--10,connect parts of our body.
e0DLg40lww8--11,What gives the different parts of the body their different shapes?
e0DLg40lww8--12," If you wanted to make a doll, what will you make first?"
e0DLg40lww8--13,Perhaps a framework to give the doll shape before making its outer structure isn't it?
e0DLg40lww8--14,All the bones in our body also form a framework to give a shape to our body.
e0DLg40lww8--15,Figure 8.7
e0DLg40lww8--16,This framework is called the skeleton.
e0DLg40lww8--17,Page 70
e0DLg40lww8--18,The human skeleton is composed of around 305 bones at birth.
e0DLg40lww8--19,The number of bones in the skeleton changes with age.
e0DLg40lww8--20,It decreases to 206 bones by adulthood after some bones have fused together.
e0DLg40lww8--21,How do we know that this is the shape of a human skeleton?
e0DLg40lww8--22,How do we know the shapes of the different bones in our body?
e0DLg40lww8--23,We can have some idea about the shape and number of bones in some parts of our body by feeling them.
e0DLg40lww8--24,One way we could know this shape better would be to look at X-ray images of the human body.
e0DLg40lww8--25,Did you or anyone in your family ever have X-ray of any part of your body taken?
e0DLg40lww8--26,Sometimes when we are hurt or have an accident
e0DLg40lww8--27,Doctors use these X-ray images to find out about any possible injuries that might have happened to the bones.
e0DLg40lww8--28,The X-rays show the shapes of the bones in our bodies.
e0DLg40lww8--29,Figure 8.7 shows the human skeleton.
e0DLg40lww8--30,Feel the bones in your forearm.
e0DLg40lww8--31," Upper arm, lower leg and upper leg"
e0DLg40lww8--32,Try to find the number of bones in each part.
e0DLg40lww8--33," Similarly, fill the bones of your ankle and knee joints and compare these with the X-ray images."
e0DLg40lww8--34,Figure 8.8
e0DLg40lww8--35,Figure 8.8 shows X-ray images of ankle and knee joints.
e0DLg40lww8--36,Bend your fingers
e0DLg40lww8--37,Are you able to bend them at every joint?
e0DLg40lww8--38,How many bones does your middle finger have?
e0DLg40lww8--39,Feel the back of your palm.
e0DLg40lww8--40,It seems to have many bones.
e0DLg40lww8--41,Isn't it?
e0DLg40lww8--42,Figure 8.9
e0DLg40lww8--43,Is your wrist flexible?
e0DLg40lww8--44,It is made up of several small bones called carples.
e0DLg40lww8--45,What will happen if it has only one bone?
e0DLg40lww8--46," Figure 8.9 Shows, Bones of the Hand."
e0DLg40lww8--47,Activity 4
e0DLg40lww8--48,Take a deep breath and hold it for a little while.
e0DLg40lww8--49,Feel your chest bones and the backbone by gently pressing the middle of the chest and back at the same time.
e0DLg40lww8--50," Count as many ribs, bones of the chest as possible."
e0DLg40lww8--51,Page number 71
e0DLg40lww8--52," Observe, figure 8.10 carefully and compare with what you feel of the chest bones."
e0DLg40lww8--53,We see that the ribs are curiously bent.
e0DLg40lww8--54,They join the chest bone and the backbone together to form a box.
e0DLg40lww8--55,This is called the rib cage.
e0DLg40lww8--56,There are 12 ribs on each side of chest.
e0DLg40lww8--57,Some important internal parts of our body lie protected inside this cage.
e0DLg40lww8--58,Ask some friends to touch their toes without bending their knees.
e0DLg40lww8--60," Starting from the neck, move your fingers downwards on the back of your friend."
e0DLg40lww8--61,What you feel is the backbone.
e0DLg40lww8--62,It is made up of many small bones called vertebrae.
e0DLg40lww8--63,The backbone consists of 33 vertebrae
e0DLg40lww8--64,Figure 8.11
e0DLg40lww8--65,The rib cage is joined to these bones. If backbone was made up...
e0DLg40lww8--66,of only one long bone.
e0DLg40lww8--67,Will your friend be able to bend?
e0DLg40lww8--68,Make your friends stand with both hands pressed to the wall and ask her to push the wall.
e0DLg40lww8--69,Do you notice two bones on the back are prominent where the shoulders are?
e0DLg40lww8--70,They are called shoulder bones.
e0DLg40lww8--71,Figure 8.12
e0DLg40lww8--72,Observe figure 8.13 carefully.
e0DLg40lww8--73,This structure is made up of pelvic bones.
e0DLg40lww8--74,They enclose the portion of your body below the stomach.
e0DLg40lww8--75,This is the part you sit on.
e0DLg40lww8--76,The skull is made up of many bones joined together figure 8.14.
e0DLg40lww8--77,It encloses and protects a very important
e0DLg40lww8--78," part of the body, the brain."
e0DLg40lww8--79,We discussed many bones and the joints of our skeleton.
e0DLg40lww8--80,page 72
e0DLg40lww8--81,There are some additional parts of the skeleton.
e0DLg40lww8--82,that are not as hard as the bones.
e0DLg40lww8--83,and which can be bent. These are called Cartilage.
e0DLg40lww8--84,feel your ear
e0DLg40lww8--85,Do you find any hard bonnie parts that can be bent?
e0DLg40lww8--86,Figure 8.15
e0DLg40lww8--87," They do not seem to be any bones here, isn't it? Do you notice anything different between the air lobe and the portions above it?"
e0DLg40lww8--88,Figure 8.16
e0DLg40lww8--89,As you press them between your fingers
e0DLg40lww8--90,You do feel something in the upper parts of the air that is not as soft as the air lobe.
e0DLg40lww8--91," But not as hard as a bone, isn't it?"
e0DLg40lww8--92,This is Cartilage. Cartilage is also found in the joints of the body.
e0DLg40lww8--93," We have seen that our skeleton is made up of many bones, joints and cartilage."
e0DLg40lww8--94," You could feel, bend and move many of them."
e0DLg40lww8--96,Draw a neat figure of the skeleton in your notebook.
e0DLg40lww8--97,We have learnt about the bones in our body and about joints that help us move in different ways.
e0DLg40lww8--98,What makes the bones move the way they do?
e0DLg40lww8--99,Let us find out.
e0DLg40lww8--100,Bend your arm at the elbow and...
e0DLg40lww8--101,touch your shoulder with the thumb.
e0DLg40lww8--102,Figure 8.17
e0DLg40lww8--103,Do you see any change in your upper arm?
e0DLg40lww8--104,Touch it with the other hand.
e0DLg40lww8--105,Do you observe a swollen region is the upper arm?
e0DLg40lww8--106,This is a muscle.
e0DLg40lww8--107,The muscle burst due to contraction.
e0DLg40lww8--108,It became smaller in length.
e0DLg40lww8--109,Now bring your arm back to its normal position.
e0DLg40lww8--110,What happened to the muscle?
e0DLg40lww8--111,Is it still contracted?
e0DLg40lww8--112,You can observe similar contraction of muscles in your leg.
e0DLg40lww8--113,when you walk or run
e0DLg40lww8--114," When contracted, the muscle becomes shorter, stiffer and thicker."
e0DLg40lww8--115,It pulls the bone.
e0DLg40lww8--116,Figure 8.17 shows two muscles work together to move a bone.
e0DLg40lww8--117, Figure A figure B
e0DLg40lww8--118,muscles work in pairs
e0DLg40lww8--119," When one of them contracts, the bone is pulled in that direction."
e0DLg40lww8--120,The other muscle of the pair relaxes.
e0DLg40lww8--121," To move the bone in the opposite direction, the relaxed muscle contracts to pull the bone towards its original position."
e0DLg40lww8--122,while the first relaxes.
e0DLg40lww8--123,A muscle can only pull.
e0DLg40lww8--124,It cannot push.
e0DLg40lww8--125," Thus, two muscles have to work together to move a bone."
e0DLg40lww8--126,Figure 8.17
e0DLg40lww8--127,Our muscles and bones always required for movement
e0DLg40lww8--128,How do other animals move?
e0DLg40lww8--129,Do all animals have bones?
e0DLg40lww8--130,What about an earthworm or a snail?
e0DLg40lww8--132,Let us study the manner of movement.
e0DLg40lww8--133,that is the gait of some animals.

kpJCJ2g6yfQ--2,Lesson number seven.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--3,The Wonder called Sleep
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--4,The synopsis for the first part.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--5,Our body and brain recover from fatigue after a good sleep.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--6,we dream while sleeping.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--7,But we do not always remember our dreams.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--8,During sleep
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--9,Our heart beat becomes slower.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--10,and our temperature and blood pressure go down.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--11,Now the lesson.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--12,We know enough about what sleep is. Though we don't know what exactly causes sleep.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--13," Sleep is a state of rest and unconscious rest. When we sleep, "
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--14,Our body recovers from fatigue caused by the day's activities.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--15,After a good sleep and the rest.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--16," that it gives, we become alert and active again, ready for the normal activities of the day."
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--17," When we wake up in the morning, it is not always"
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--18,possible for us to remember what
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--19,happened when we were asleep.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--20," We may remember a dream, but the rest of our sleep was a kind of darkness in which nothing seems to have taken place."
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--21,page number 26
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--22,Several things happen to our body while we are sleeping.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--23," As we sink deeper into sleep, our muscles relax more and more."
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--24,Our heartbeat becomes slower. Our temperature and blood pressure.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--25,Go down.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--26,The ever active brain also slows down so that we can't think...
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--27,or act consciously.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--28,But we dream. When we wake up
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--29,Our temperature and blood pressure rise to normal. Our heartbeat and breathing...
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--30,also become normal and we are fully awake.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--32,and have forgotten most if not all the dreams that we had while sleeping.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--33,Now this synopsis for the next part.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--34,A dream is an activity of the mind.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--35,when we are asleep.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--36,Dreams help us sleep through noise and other disturbances.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--37," Dreams may reveal something about one's problems, but they cannot tell the future."
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--38,Now the next part of the lesson.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--40,What is a dream?
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--41,It is an activity of the mind that takes...
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--42,please when we are asleep.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--43,Some dreams are probable while others are not.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--44,That only means that many of the things that happen in dreams could happen when we are awake.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--45,Others could not.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--46,Dreams seem to be important for several reasons.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--47,One is that a dream can help us to sleep through noise or other disturbances. For example...
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--48," The alarm clock rings, but our mind causes us to dream that the telephone or doorbell is ringing."
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--49,and that we are awake and answering it.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--50,Certain doctors have found that once dreams often reveal a great deal about one's problems and that
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--51," If understood correctly, they can provide a key to the solution of those problems."
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--52,But we must remember one thing. Dreams cannot be used
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--53,as a way to tell the future. They simply can never tell the future.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--54,page number 27
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--55," Sleep is the most common experience, but how many of us really think about the wonder and power of sleep?"
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--56,Many poets have written beautiful poems about sleep.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--57," Here is one, in which the poet is describing the experience of falling asleep. Read it aloud."
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--58,lights out
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--59,I have come to the borders of sleep.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--60,The unfathomable deep.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--61,forest where all must lose their way.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--62,however straight
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--63,or winding soon or late.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--64,They cannot choose.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--65,there is not any book.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--66,or face of dearest look.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--67,that I would not turn from now to go into the unknown. I must enter and leave alone I know not how.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--68,This is written by Edward Thomas.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--70,Question number one.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--71,What is the most obvious advantage of sleep?
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--72,Question number two. What happens to our body?
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--73,when we sleep. Question number three.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--74,Define a dream in your own words.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--75,Question number 4
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--76,Why are dreams important? Mention two reasons.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--77,Question number five
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--78,Why has sleep been called a wonder?
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--79,Question number six.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--80,Describe briefly to the class an improbable dream you have had.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--81,Grandmothers and mothers sing nice little songs while rocking little ones to sleep.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--82,Such a song is called a lullaby
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--83,Do you remember a lullaby
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--84,in your own language.
kpJCJ2g6yfQ--85,Tell the class in English what the Lullaby says.

ByGP6VSsADs--2,What if?
ByGP6VSsADs--3,Are there times when your mind fills with fear? Have you ever thought?
ByGP6VSsADs--4,What if something dangerous happens to me or
ByGP6VSsADs--5,or the people around me.
ByGP6VSsADs--6,What if the world stops revolving around the sun?
ByGP6VSsADs--7,What?
ByGP6VSsADs--8," If the sun does not rise in the morning,"
ByGP6VSsADs--9,Here is a poem which talks about some more such what-ifs.
ByGP6VSsADs--10,What if by Shel Silverstein
ByGP6VSsADs--12,Last night while I lay thinking here
ByGP6VSsADs--14,Some what ifs crawled inside my ear.
ByGP6VSsADs--15,and pranced and partied all night long.
ByGP6VSsADs--16,and sang their same old What If song.
ByGP6VSsADs--17,What if I'm dumb in school?
ByGP6VSsADs--18,What if they have closed the swimming pool?
ByGP6VSsADs--20,What if I get beat up?
ByGP6VSsADs--21,What if there's a poison in my cup?
ByGP6VSsADs--22,What if I start to cry?
ByGP6VSsADs--23,What if I get sick and die?
ByGP6VSsADs--24,What if I flunk that test?
ByGP6VSsADs--25,What if green hair grows on my chest?
ByGP6VSsADs--26,What if nobody likes me?
ByGP6VSsADs--27,What if a bolt of lightning strikes me? What if I don't grow taller?
ByGP6VSsADs--28,What if...
ByGP6VSsADs--29,My head starts getting smaller.
ByGP6VSsADs--30,What if the fish won't bite? What if the wind?
ByGP6VSsADs--31,tears up my kite.
ByGP6VSsADs--32,What if they start a war?
ByGP6VSsADs--33,What if my parents get divorced?
ByGP6VSsADs--34,What if the bus is late?
ByGP6VSsADs--35,What if my teeth don't grow in straight?
ByGP6VSsADs--36,What if I tear my pants?
ByGP6VSsADs--37,What if I never learn to dance?
ByGP6VSsADs--38,Everything seems swell and then the night-time what if strikes again?
ByGP6VSsADs--39,Page 122.
ByGP6VSsADs--40,Working with the poem.
ByGP6VSsADs--41,1
ByGP6VSsADs--42,Who is the speaker in the poem?
ByGP6VSsADs--43,2
ByGP6VSsADs--44," With your partner, list out the happenings the speaker is worried about."
ByGP6VSsADs--45,Three
ByGP6VSsADs--46,Why do you think she or he has these worries?
ByGP6VSsADs--47,Can you think of ways to get rid of such worries?
ByGP6VSsADs--48,two
ByGP6VSsADs--49,Read the following line.
ByGP6VSsADs--50,some of what ifs crawled inside my ear.
ByGP6VSsADs--51,Can words crawl into your ear?
ByGP6VSsADs--52,This is an image.
ByGP6VSsADs--53,The poet is trying to make an image of what she or he experiences.
ByGP6VSsADs--54,Now with your partner try and list out some more images from the poem.
ByGP6VSsADs--55," In groups of four discuss, some more what ifs that you experience in your day-to-day life and list them out."
ByGP6VSsADs--56,Right about.
ByGP6VSsADs--57,eight sentences
ByGP6VSsADs--58,Page 123
ByGP6VSsADs--59,and now write a poem of 5 or 6 lines with the what ifs that you have listed.

iuGT90_P4Qk--1,16 shapes
iuGT90_P4Qk--2,and angles.
iuGT90_P4Qk--3,Rohini and Mohini are twin sisters.
iuGT90_P4Qk--4,They love doing the same things. One day
iuGT90_P4Qk--5,when they were making shapes with match sticks.
iuGT90_P4Qk--6,Shaila gave them a challenge.
iuGT90_P4Qk--7,There is a picture of the three girls.
iuGT90_P4Qk--8,Rohini Mohini and Shaila
iuGT90_P4Qk--9,Rohini and Mohini are busy doing something?
iuGT90_P4Qk--10,and Shaila gave them a challenge by saying
iuGT90_P4Qk--11,Rohini will make a shape.
iuGT90_P4Qk--12,Mohini has to make the same without looking at it.
iuGT90_P4Qk--13,but she can ask questions.
iuGT90_P4Qk--14," To this, Mohini says... Oooo!"
iuGT90_P4Qk--15,That is simple.
iuGT90_P4Qk--16,Rohini made this shape.
iuGT90_P4Qk--17,There is a small picture of the shape made by Rohini.
iuGT90_P4Qk--18,Mohini
iuGT90_P4Qk--19,Is it a closed shape or an open shape? Rohini
iuGT90_P4Qk--20,It is a closed shape. Mohini
iuGT90_P4Qk--21,How many sides are there
iuGT90_P4Qk--22,It has six sides.
iuGT90_P4Qk--23,Mohini made this.
iuGT90_P4Qk--24,We have a picture of the shape made by Mohini. Now...
iuGT90_P4Qk--25,You give the answers.
iuGT90_P4Qk--26,Is it a closed shape?
iuGT90_P4Qk--27,DASH
iuGT90_P4Qk--28,Does it have six sides?
iuGT90_P4Qk--29,Does it have six sides?
iuGT90_P4Qk--30,It is not the same as the one made by Rohini.
iuGT90_P4Qk--31," So, Mohini tried again."
iuGT90_P4Qk--32,This is what she made.
iuGT90_P4Qk--33,We have a picture of the shape made by Rohini. Page
iuGT90_P4Qk--34,17. is it a
iuGT90_P4Qk--35,Closed shape with 6 sides. Dash
iuGT90_P4Qk--36,Is it the same as the one made by Rohini?
iuGT90_P4Qk--37,dash
iuGT90_P4Qk--38,Is there some way to say in what way these shapes are different?
iuGT90_P4Qk--39,Mohini tried again. But got different shapes.
iuGT90_P4Qk--41,Guess and make two more shapes Mohini could have made.
iuGT90_P4Qk--42,Mohini is now tired of trying.
iuGT90_P4Qk--43,and ask Shaila.
iuGT90_P4Qk--44,What to do?
iuGT90_P4Qk--45,Shaila tells her.
iuGT90_P4Qk--46," If you ask for the angles that the matchsticks make at the corners,"
iuGT90_P4Qk--47,You can do it.
iuGT90_P4Qk--48," To this Mohini replies, oh!"
iuGT90_P4Qk--49,So let us look for the angles.
iuGT90_P4Qk--50,Look at the angles marked in these shapes.
iuGT90_P4Qk--51,Can you see the difference? We have...
iuGT90_P4Qk--52,Few shapes
iuGT90_P4Qk--53,made by Rohini and Mohini.
iuGT90_P4Qk--54,with different angles marked in the pictures.
iuGT90_P4Qk--55,Rohini says see
iuGT90_P4Qk--56,How the matchsticks make a small angle?
iuGT90_P4Qk--57,A big angle and a bigger angle.
iuGT90_P4Qk--58," to this mohini replies, wow."
iuGT90_P4Qk--59,When the angle changes...
iuGT90_P4Qk--60,The shape changes so much.
iuGT90_P4Qk--61,It is important to encourage children to think about the way in which shapes can differ.
iuGT90_P4Qk--62,even when the number of sides is the same. This will help them to get a sense of.
iuGT90_P4Qk--63,How angles determine the shape of a...
iuGT90_P4Qk--64,polygon.
iuGT90_P4Qk--65,practice time.
iuGT90_P4Qk--67,and answer.
iuGT90_P4Qk--68,Next to the question we have a small picture of a pentagon.
iuGT90_P4Qk--69,the angle marked in dash color.
iuGT90_P4Qk--70,is the biggest angle. 2
iuGT90_P4Qk--71," Below the question we have, four pictures."
iuGT90_P4Qk--72,2 of Pentagon and 2 of
iuGT90_P4Qk--73,Octagon.
iuGT90_P4Qk--74,All the pictures have different angles marked in different colors. A.
iuGT90_P4Qk--75,Are the angles marked with yellow equal?
iuGT90_P4Qk--76,dash B
iuGT90_P4Qk--77,Are the angles marked with green equal?
iuGT90_P4Qk--78,dash. C.
iuGT90_P4Qk--79,Are the angles marked with blue equal? Yes.
iuGT90_P4Qk--80,3
iuGT90_P4Qk--81,Four different angles are marked in four corners.
iuGT90_P4Qk--82,Can you find other angles which are the same as the one marked in red?
iuGT90_P4Qk--83,Mark them in red.
iuGT90_P4Qk--84,Do this for the other colors.
iuGT90_P4Qk--85,page 19. page 4.
iuGT90_P4Qk--86,How many different shapes can you make by changing the angle between the match sticks?
iuGT90_P4Qk--87,in each of these.
iuGT90_P4Qk--88,try a 
iuGT90_P4Qk--89,4 matchsticks B
iuGT90_P4Qk--90,8 matchsticks C
iuGT90_P4Qk--91,5 matchsticks D
iuGT90_P4Qk--92,7 matchsticks 20
iuGT90_P4Qk--93,10 matchsticks Matchstick
iuGT90_P4Qk--94,puzzles 1.
iuGT90_P4Qk--95,Make 8 triangles using 6 matchsticks.
iuGT90_P4Qk--96,try 2
iuGT90_P4Qk--97,Take 8 matchsticks and make a fish.
iuGT90_P4Qk--98,like this.
iuGT90_P4Qk--99," Now, pick up any three matchsticks."
iuGT90_P4Qk--100,and put them in such a way.
iuGT90_P4Qk--101,that the fish now starts swimming in the opposite direction.
iuGT90_P4Qk--102,Did it?
iuGT90_P4Qk--103," Using 10 matchsticks, make this shape."
iuGT90_P4Qk--104,Pick up 5 matchsticks.
iuGT90_P4Qk--105,and put them in such a way that you get the shape of a house.
iuGT90_P4Qk--106,If you have not been able to solve these...
iuGT90_P4Qk--107,Then look for the answers on page 29.
nLG-B3e-pP0--1,For class 6
nLG-B3e-pP0--2," Entitled, Science 1"
nLG-B3e-pP0--3,This is the lesson 5.
nLG-B3e-pP0--4," Title, separation of substances"
nLG-B3e-pP0--5,page 35.
nLG-B3e-pP0--6," In our daily life, there are many instances when we notice a substance being separated from a mixture of materials."
nLG-B3e-pP0--7,T-leaves are separated from the liquid with a strainer while preparing tea.
nLG-B3e-pP0--8,Green is separated from stalks while harvesting.
nLG-B3e-pP0--9,Milk or curd is churned to separate the butter. Figure 5.2
nLG-B3e-pP0--10," As we learned in chapter 3, we gain cotton to separate its seeds from the fiber."
nLG-B3e-pP0--11,Perhaps you might have eaten salted Daliya or Pha.
nLG-B3e-pP0--12," If you found that it had chillies in it, you may have carefully taken them out before eating."
nLG-B3e-pP0--13,Suppose you are given a basket containing mangoes and guavas and asked to separate them.
nLG-B3e-pP0--15,What would you do?
nLG-B3e-pP0--16," Pick out one kind and place them in a separate container, right?"
nLG-B3e-pP0--17,Seems easy. But what if the materials we want to separate are much smaller than mango or guava?
nLG-B3e-pP0--18,Imagine you are given a glass of sand with salt mixed in it.
nLG-B3e-pP0--19," Impossible, even to think of separating salt from this mixture by picking out grains of sand by hand."
nLG-B3e-pP0--20,FIGURE 5.2
nLG-B3e-pP0--21,Butter is taken out by churning milk or curd.
nLG-B3e-pP0--22,But why would we need to separate substances like this at all?
nLG-B3e-pP0--23,Is what Paheli wants to know?
nLG-B3e-pP0--25,Activity 1
nLG-B3e-pP0--26,In column 1 of table 5.1
nLG-B3e-pP0--27,are given a few processes of separation. The purpose of separation and the way separated components are used is...
nLG-B3e-pP0--28,is mentioned in column 2.
nLG-B3e-pP0--29," and 3 respectively. However,"
nLG-B3e-pP0--30,The information given in columns 2 and 3 is jumbled up.
nLG-B3e-pP0--31,Can you match each process with its purpose and the way separated components are used? Page 36
nLG-B3e-pP0--32,Table 5.1
nLG-B3e-pP0--33,Why do we separate substances?
nLG-B3e-pP0--35,There are three columns in the table. One is separation process.
nLG-B3e-pP0--37," Second is, purpose for which we do the separation."
nLG-B3e-pP0--38," And the third one is, what do we do with the separated components?"
nLG-B3e-pP0--40,1.Separate stones from rice
nLG-B3e-pP0--42,A. To separate two different but useful components.
nLG-B3e-pP0--43,1. We throw away the solid component. 2.
nLG-B3e-pP0--44,Churning milk to obtain butter.
nLG-B3e-pP0--45,B
nLG-B3e-pP0--46,to remove non-useful components.
nLG-B3e-pP0--47,We throw away the impurities.
nLG-B3e-pP0--49,3. Separate T-Leaves
nLG-B3e-pP0--51,"C, to remove impurities or harmful components."
nLG-B3e-pP0--52,3. We use both the components
nLG-B3e-pP0--53,We see that before we use a substance we need to separate harmful or non-useful substances that maybe mixed with it.
nLG-B3e-pP0--54,Sometimes we separate even useful components if we need to use them separately.
nLG-B3e-pP0--55,The substance is to be separated may be particles of different sizes or materials.
nLG-B3e-pP0--56,These may be in any three states of matter.
nLG-B3e-pP0--57,that is solid
nLG-B3e-pP0--58,liquid
nLG-B3e-pP0--59,or gas.
nLG-B3e-pP0--60," So, how do we separate substances mixed together if they have so many different properties?"
nLG-B3e-pP0--61," 5.1, Methods of Separation"
nLG-B3e-pP0--62,We will discuss some simple methods of separating substances that are mixed together.
nLG-B3e-pP0--63,You may come across some of these methods being used in day-to-day activities.
nLG-B3e-pP0--64,Hand-picking
nLG-B3e-pP0--65,Activity 2
nLG-B3e-pP0--66,Bring a packet of food grain purchased from a shop to the classroom.
nLG-B3e-pP0--67,Now spread the grains on a sheet of paper.
nLG-B3e-pP0--68,Do you find only one kind of grain on the sheet of paper?
nLG-B3e-pP0--69," Are there pieces of stone, husks, broken grain?"
nLG-B3e-pP0--70,and particles of any other grain in it.
nLG-B3e-pP0--71," Now, remove with your hand the pieces of stone, husks and other grains from it."
nLG-B3e-pP0--72," This method of hand-picking can be used for separating slightly larger sized impurities like the pieces of dirt, stone and husk from wheat, rice or pulses."
nLG-B3e-pP0--73,FIGURE 5.3
nLG-B3e-pP0--74," The quantity of such impurities is usually not very large. In such situations, we find that hand picking is a convenient method of separating substances."
nLG-B3e-pP0--75,Here is figure 5.3
nLG-B3e-pP0--76,Threshing
nLG-B3e-pP0--77,You must have seen bundles of wheat or paddy stalks lying in fields after harvesting the crop.
nLG-B3e-pP0--78,Stalks are dried in the sun before the grain is separated from them.
nLG-B3e-pP0--79,Page 37
nLG-B3e-pP0--80,Each stock has many grain seeds attached to it.
nLG-B3e-pP0--81,Imagine the number of grain seeds in hundreds of bundles of stock lying in the field.
nLG-B3e-pP0--82,How does the farmer separate grain seeds from those bundles of stalks?
nLG-B3e-pP0--83," One may pluck mangoes or guavas from the trees, but grain seeds are much smaller than mangoes or guavas."
nLG-B3e-pP0--84," So, plucking them from their stalks would be impossible."
nLG-B3e-pP0--85,How does one separate grain seeds from their stalks?
nLG-B3e-pP0--86,The process that is used to separate grain from stalks etc is threshing.
nLG-B3e-pP0--87," In this process, the stalks are beaten to free the grain seeds."
nLG-B3e-pP0--88,Figure 5.4
nLG-B3e-pP0--89," Sometimes, threshing is done with the help of bullocks."
nLG-B3e-pP0--90,Machines are also used to threshold large quantities of grain.
nLG-B3e-pP0--91,Winnowing
nLG-B3e-pP0--92,Activity 3
nLG-B3e-pP0--93,Make a mixture of dry sand with sawdust or powdered dry leaves.
nLG-B3e-pP0--94,Keep this mixture on a plate or a newspaper. Look at this mixture carefully.
nLG-B3e-pP0--95,Can the two different components be made out easily?
nLG-B3e-pP0--96,Are the sizes of particles of the two components similar? Would it be possible?
nLG-B3e-pP0--97,to separate the components by hand picking.
nLG-B3e-pP0--98,Now take your mixture to an open ground.
nLG-B3e-pP0--99,and stand on a raised platform.
nLG-B3e-pP0--100,Put the mixture in a plate or sheet of paper.
nLG-B3e-pP0--101,Hold the plate or the sheet of paper containing the mixture at your shoulder height. Tilt it slightly so that...
nLG-B3e-pP0--102,the mixture slides out slowly. What happens? Do both the components sand and sawdust or powdered leaves fall at the same place? Is there a component that blows away? Did the wind manage to separate the two components?
nLG-B3e-pP0--103,This method of separating components of a mixture is called winnowing.
nLG-B3e-pP0--104,winnowing is used to separate heavier and lighter components of a mixture by wind or by blowing air.
nLG-B3e-pP0--105,FIGURE 5.5
nLG-B3e-pP0--106,Page 38
nLG-B3e-pP0--107,This method is commonly used by farmers to separate lighter husk particles from heavier seeds of grain.
nLG-B3e-pP0--108,as shown in figure 5.5.
nLG-B3e-pP0--109,The husk particles are carried away by the wind.
nLG-B3e-pP0--110,The seeds of grain get separated and form a heap near the platform for winnowing.
nLG-B3e-pP0--111," The separated husk is used for many purposes, such as..."
nLG-B3e-pP0--112,FODdER FOR cattles
nLG-B3e-pP0--113,Sieving
nLG-B3e-pP0--114," Sometimes, we may wish to prepare a dish with flour."
nLG-B3e-pP0--115,We need to remove impurities and bran that may be present in it. What do we do?
nLG-B3e-pP0--117,We use a sieve and pour the flour into it. Figure 5.6 Seving allows the fine flour
nLG-B3e-pP0--118,particles to pass through the holes of the sieve while the bigger impurities remain on the sieve.
nLG-B3e-pP0--119," In a flour mill, impurities like husk and stones are removed from wheat before grinding it."
nLG-B3e-pP0--121,Usually a bagful of weight is poured on a slanting sieve.
nLG-B3e-pP0--122," The seaving removes pieces of stones, stalk and husk that may still remain with wheat after threshing and winnowing."
nLG-B3e-pP0--123,Figure
nLG-B3e-pP0--124,5.6 shows the process of sieving.
nLG-B3e-pP0--125,You may have also noticed similar sieves being used at construction sites.
nLG-B3e-pP0--126,to separate pebbles and stones from sand.
nLG-B3e-pP0--127,as shown in figure 5.7. Activity 4.
nLG-B3e-pP0--128,Bring a sieve and a small quantity of flour from home to the class.
nLG-B3e-pP0--129,Seave the flower to separate any impurities in it. Now make a...
nLG-B3e-pP0--130,find powder of chalk pieces and mix it with the flour.
nLG-B3e-pP0--131,Can we separate the flour and the powdered chalk by sieving?
nLG-B3e-pP0--132,Searing is used when components of a mixture have different sizes.
nLG-B3e-pP0--133,sedimentation
nLG-B3e-pP0--134,Decantation
nLG-B3e-pP0--135,and filtration.
nLG-B3e-pP0--136,Sometimes it may not be possible to separate components of a mixture by winnowing and hand picking.
nLG-B3e-pP0--137," For example, there may be lighter impurities like dust or soil particles in rice or pulses."
nLG-B3e-pP0--138,How are such impurities separated from rice or pulses before cooking?
nLG-B3e-pP0--139,Rice or pulses are usually washed before cooking.
nLG-B3e-pP0--140," When you add water to these, the impurities like dust particles get separated."
nLG-B3e-pP0--142,page 39.
nLG-B3e-pP0--143,These impurities go into water.
nLG-B3e-pP0--144," Now, what we will sink to the bottom of the vessel? Rice or dust?"
nLG-B3e-pP0--145,Why?
nLG-B3e-pP0--146,Have you seen that the vessel is tilted to pour out the dirty water?
nLG-B3e-pP0--147,When the heavier component in a mixture settles after water is added.
nLG-B3e-pP0--148,it the process is called sedimentation.
nLG-B3e-pP0--149," When the water along with the dust is removed, the process is called decantation."
nLG-B3e-pP0--150,figure 5.8
nLG-B3e-pP0--151,Let us find a few other mixtures that can be separated through sedimentation and decantation.
nLG-B3e-pP0--152,The same principle is used for separating a mixture of two liquids that do not mix with each other.
nLG-B3e-pP0--153," For example, oil and water from their mixture can be separated by this process."
nLG-B3e-pP0--154," If a mixture of such liquids is allowed to stand for some time, they form two separate layers. The component"
nLG-B3e-pP0--155,that forms the top layer can then be separated by decantation.
nLG-B3e-pP0--157,Let us again consider a mixture of solid and liquid.
nLG-B3e-pP0--158," After preparing tea, what do you do to remove the tea leaves?"
nLG-B3e-pP0--159," Usually, we use strainer to remove Tea leaves."
nLG-B3e-pP0--160,Try decantation. It helps a little.
nLG-B3e-pP0--161," But, do you still get a few leaves in your tea?"
nLG-B3e-pP0--162,Now pour the tea through our strainer.
nLG-B3e-pP0--164,Did all the tea leaves remain in the strainer?
nLG-B3e-pP0--165,This process is called filtration.
nLG-B3e-pP0--166,Figure 5.1
nLG-B3e-pP0--167,Which method of separating Tea leaves from prepared Tea is better? Decantation or filtration?
nLG-B3e-pP0--168,Figure 5.8 Shows
nLG-B3e-pP0--169,Separating two components of a mixture by sedimentation and decantation.
nLG-B3e-pP0--170,Let us now consider the example of water that we use.
nLG-B3e-pP0--171,Do all of us at all times get safe water to drink?
nLG-B3e-pP0--172,Sometimes water supplied through traps may be muddy. The water collected from ponds
nLG-B3e-pP0--173,or rivers may also be muddy.
nLG-B3e-pP0--174,especially after rains.
nLG-B3e-pP0--175,Let us see if we can use some method of separation to remove insoluble impurities like soil from the water.
nLG-B3e-pP0--176,Activity 5
nLG-B3e-pP0--177,collect some muddy water from a pond or a river.
nLG-B3e-pP0--178," If it is not available, mix some soil to water in a glass."
nLG-B3e-pP0--179,Let it stand for half an hour.
nLG-B3e-pP0--180,Observe the water carefully and note your observations.
nLG-B3e-pP0--181,Do some soil settle at the bottom of water? Why?
nLG-B3e-pP0--182,What will you call this process?
nLG-B3e-pP0--183," Now, slightly tilt the glass without disturbing the water. Let the water from the top flow into another glass."
nLG-B3e-pP0--184,Figure 5.8
nLG-B3e-pP0--185,What will you call this process?
nLG-B3e-pP0--186,Is the water in the second glass still muddy or brown in color?
nLG-B3e-pP0--187,Now filter it. Did the Tea strainer work?
nLG-B3e-pP0--188," Let us try filtering the water through a piece of cloth. In a piece of cloth, small holes are pores remaining between the woven threads."
nLG-B3e-pP0--189,These pores in a cloth can be used as a filter.
nLG-B3e-pP0--190,Page 40
nLG-B3e-pP0--191," If the water is still muddy, impurities can be separated by a filter that has even smaller pores."
nLG-B3e-pP0--192,A filter paper is one such filter that has very fine pores in it.
nLG-B3e-pP0--193,Figure 5.9 shows the steps involved in using a filter paper.
nLG-B3e-pP0--194,a filter paper
nLG-B3e-pP0--195," Folded in the form of a cone, is fixed onto a funnel."
nLG-B3e-pP0--196,Figure 5.10
nLG-B3e-pP0--197,The mixture is then poured on the filter paper.
nLG-B3e-pP0--198,Solid particles in the mixture do not pass through it and remain on the filter.
nLG-B3e-pP0--200,Figure 5.9 shows folding a filter paper to make a cone.
nLG-B3e-pP0--201,Figure 5.10 shows filtration process using a filter paper.
nLG-B3e-pP0--202,Fruit and vegetable juices are usually filtered before drinking to separate the seeds and solid particles of pulp.
nLG-B3e-pP0--203,The method of filtration is also used in the process of preparing cottage cheese or paneer in our homes.
nLG-B3e-pP0--204,You might have seen that for making paneer a few drops of lemon juice are added to milk as it boils.
nLG-B3e-pP0--205,This gives a mixture of particles of solid paneer and a liquid. The paneer is then separated by filtering the mixture through a fine cloth or a strainer.

XVP5zcTXVtc--11,while she badly wanted to buy a new CD.
XVP5zcTXVtc--12,She also wanted to just see and feel the brand new notes.
XVP5zcTXVtc--13,It was then...

XVP5zcTXVtc--97,as the Empire was so large.
XVP5zcTXVtc--98,Different parts were ruled differently.
XVP5zcTXVtc--100,The area around Patliputra was under the direct control of the Emperor.

XVP5zcTXVtc--110,The Emperor supervised them all.
XVP5zcTXVtc--112,with the help of members of the Royal Family and Senior Ministers.
XVP5zcTXVtc--114,There were other areas or provinces.

XVP5zcTXVtc--159,The king is normally surrounded by armed women.
XVP5zcTXVtc--161,He's afraid that someone may try to kill him.
XVP5zcTXVtc--162,He has special servants to taste the food before he eats.
XVP5zcTXVtc--164,He never sleeps in the same bedroom for two nights.
XVP5zcTXVtc--165,And about Pataliputra 
XVP5zcTXVtc--166,"(modern Patna), he wrote:"

3AGKPSOZMmc--1," page number one, lesson one"
3AGKPSOZMmc--3,a tale of two birds.
3AGKPSOZMmc--5,The synopsis of the first part is
3AGKPSOZMmc--6,a mother bird and two young ones.
3AGKPSOZMmc--7,lived in a forest.
3AGKPSOZMmc--8,The mother was killed in a storm and the young birds were separated from each other.
3AGKPSOZMmc--9,Each found a different home.
3AGKPSOZMmc--10," Now, the lesson."
3AGKPSOZMmc--11,There once lived a bird and a two newborn babies in a forest.
3AGKPSOZMmc--13," They had a nest in a tall, shady tree."
3AGKPSOZMmc--14,And there the mother bird took care of her little ones.
3AGKPSOZMmc--15,Day and Night
3AGKPSOZMmc--16," One day, there was a big storm. There was thunder, lightning and rain. And the wind blew down many trees."
3AGKPSOZMmc--17,The tall tree in which the birds lived also came down.
3AGKPSOZMmc--18,A big heavy branch hit the nest.
3AGKPSOZMmc--19,and kill the bird.
3AGKPSOZMmc--20," Fortunately, for the baby birds, the strong wind blew them away to the other side of the forest."
3AGKPSOZMmc--24," The other landed outside a Rishis ashram, a little distance away."
3AGKPSOZMmc--25,page number 2. These days passed
3AGKPSOZMmc--26,and the baby birds became big birds.
3AGKPSOZMmc--27," One day, the king of the country came to the forest to hunt. He saw a deer."
3AGKPSOZMmc--28," and rode after it, it ran deep into the forest followed by the king. Soon the king lost"
3AGKPSOZMmc--29,his way and didn't know where he was.
3AGKPSOZMmc--30,He ruled on for a long time.
3AGKPSOZMmc--31," till he came to the other side of the forest. Very tired by now, he got off his horse and sat down under a tree that stood near a cave."
3AGKPSOZMmc--33," Suddenly, he heard a voice cry out. Quick!"
3AGKPSOZMmc--34,Hurry up! There is someone here under the tree. Come and take his jewels and his horse. Hurry!
3AGKPSOZMmc--35,or else he'll slip away.
3AGKPSOZMmc--36,The king was amazed. He looked up and saw a big brown bird on the
3AGKPSOZMmc--37,tree under which he was sitting.
3AGKPSOZMmc--38," He also heard faint noises, issuing from the cave. He quickly got on to his horse, and rode away as fast as he could."
3AGKPSOZMmc--40,Now the synopsis of the second part of the lesson.
3AGKPSOZMmc--41,The king was amazed to hear a similar voice again.
3AGKPSOZMmc--42,He came to know the bird's true story.
3AGKPSOZMmc--43, He met the Rishi who explained the behavior of each bird. Soon
3AGKPSOZMmc--44,He came to a clearing which looked like an ashram. It was the Rishis ashram. The king tied his horse
3AGKPSOZMmc--45,to a tree and sat down in its shade.
3AGKPSOZMmc--47," Suddenly, he heard a gentle voice announce. Welcome to the..."
3AGKPSOZMmc--48," Ashram, Sir, please go inside and rest. The Rishi will be back soon. There is some cold water in the pot. Please make yourself comfortable."
3AGKPSOZMmc--49,The king looked up and saw a big brown bird in the tree. He was amazed. This one looks like the other bird outside the cave.
3AGKPSOZMmc--50," He said to himself loudly, Your right sir answered the bird. He is my brother, but he has made friends with robbers."
3AGKPSOZMmc--51,He now talks as they do. He doesn't talk to me anymore.
3AGKPSOZMmc--52," Just then, the Rishi entered the Ashram."
3AGKPSOZMmc--53,page number three
3AGKPSOZMmc--54," Welcome, sir. He said to the king. Please come inside and make yourself at home."
3AGKPSOZMmc--55,You look tired.
3AGKPSOZMmc--56,Rest for a while.
3AGKPSOZMmc--57,Then you can share my food.
3AGKPSOZMmc--59,The King told the Rishi the story of the two birds and how each had behaved so differently though they looked so alike.
3AGKPSOZMmc--60,The forest is full of surprises he said.
3AGKPSOZMmc--61,the holy man smiled and said. After all.
3AGKPSOZMmc--62,One is known by the company one keeps. That
3AGKPSOZMmc--63,Bird has always heard the talk of robbers.
3AGKPSOZMmc--64,He imitates them and talks about robbing people.
3AGKPSOZMmc--65,This one has repeated.
3AGKPSOZMmc--66,what he has always heard.
3AGKPSOZMmc--67,He welcomes people to the ashram.
3AGKPSOZMmc--68,Now come inside and rest. I'll tell you more about this place and these birds.
3AGKPSOZMmc--69,Now the questions.
3AGKPSOZMmc--70,Question number one.
3AGKPSOZMmc--71,How did the two baby birds get separated?
3AGKPSOZMmc--72,Question number two.
3AGKPSOZMmc--73,Where did each of them find a home?
3AGKPSOZMmc--74,Question number three.
3AGKPSOZMmc--75,What did the first bird say to the stranger?
3AGKPSOZMmc--77,Question number four.
3AGKPSOZMmc--78,What did the second bird say to him?
3AGKPSOZMmc--79,Question number five.
3AGKPSOZMmc--80,how did the Rishi explain the different ways in which the birds behaved?
3AGKPSOZMmc--81,Question number six.
3AGKPSOZMmc--82,which one or the following sums up the story best?
3AGKPSOZMmc--83,1
3AGKPSOZMmc--84,A bird in hand is worth two in the bush. Two
3AGKPSOZMmc--85,One is known by the company one keeps

WxKh6dYTUOU--3,Standard units of measurement.
WxKh6dYTUOU--4," In ancient times, the length of a foot, the width of a finger and the distance of a step were commonly used as different units of measurements."
WxKh6dYTUOU--5,the people of the Indus Valley civilization
WxKh6dYTUOU--6,must have used very good measurements of land.
WxKh6dYTUOU--7,Because we see evidence in excavations of perfectly geometrical constructions.
WxKh6dYTUOU--8,A cubit as the length from the elbow to the fingertips was used in ancient Egypt.
WxKh6dYTUOU--9,and was also accepted as a unit of length in other parts of the world.
WxKh6dYTUOU--10,People also used the foot as a unit of length in different parts of the world. The length of the foot used varied slightly from region to region.
WxKh6dYTUOU--11,People measured a yard of cloth by the distance between the end of the outstretched arm and their chin.
WxKh6dYTUOU--12,The Romans measured with their pace or steps.
WxKh6dYTUOU--13," In ancient India, small length measurements used were an angle. In ancient India, small length measurements used were an angle."
WxKh6dYTUOU--14,which is a finger or a mutti fist.
WxKh6dYTUOU--15," Even today, we can see flowers sellers using their 4 arms as a unit of length for garlands in many towns of India."
WxKh6dYTUOU--16,Many such body parts continue to be in use as unit of length when convenient.
WxKh6dYTUOU--17," However, everyone's body parts could be of slightly different sizes."
WxKh6dYTUOU--18,This must have caused confusion in measurement.
WxKh6dYTUOU--19," In 1790, the French created a standard unit of measurement called"
WxKh6dYTUOU--20,The Metric System
WxKh6dYTUOU--21," For the sake of uniformity, scientists all over the world have accepted a set of standard units of measurement. The system of unit"
WxKh6dYTUOU--22,Now used is known as the International System of Units.
WxKh6dYTUOU--23,S.I. Unit
WxKh6dYTUOU--24,The SI unit of length is a meter.
WxKh6dYTUOU--25,A meter scale is shown in figure 10.6.
WxKh6dYTUOU--26,Also shown is the 15 cm scale in your geometry box.
WxKh6dYTUOU--27,Each meter is divided into 100 equal divisions called centimeter.
WxKh6dYTUOU--28,Each centimeter has 10 equal divisions called millimeter.
WxKh6dYTUOU--29," Thus, 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeter."
WxKh6dYTUOU--30,2 cm is equal to 10 mm.
WxKh6dYTUOU--31," For measuring large distances, meter is not a convenient unit."
WxKh6dYTUOU--32,We define a larger unit of length.
WxKh6dYTUOU--33,It is called Kilometer. 1 km is equal to 2 km.
WxKh6dYTUOU--34,1000m
WxKh6dYTUOU--35,Now we can repeat all our measurement activities using a standard scale and measure in SI units.
WxKh6dYTUOU--36," Before we do that, we do need to know the correct way of measuring lengths and distances."
WxKh6dYTUOU--37,10.5
WxKh6dYTUOU--38,correct measurement of length
WxKh6dYTUOU--39," In our daily life, we use various types of measuring devices."
WxKh6dYTUOU--40,We use a meter scale for measuring length.
WxKh6dYTUOU--42,Page 100.
WxKh6dYTUOU--43,A tailor uses a tape whereas a cloth merchant uses a meter rod.
WxKh6dYTUOU--44," For measuring the length of an object, you must choose a suitable device."
WxKh6dYTUOU--45,You cannot measure the girth of a tree or the size of your chest.
WxKh6dYTUOU--46,using a meter scale for instance.
WxKh6dYTUOU--47,measuring tape is more suitable for this.
WxKh6dYTUOU--48," For small measurements such as the length of your pencil, you can use a 15 cm scale from your geometry box. For small measurements such as the length of your pencil, you can use a 15 cm scale from your geometry box."

WxKh6dYTUOU--50,1 place the scale in
WxKh6dYTUOU--51,Contact with the object along its length as shown in figure.
WxKh6dYTUOU--52,10.7 12.
WxKh6dYTUOU--53,In some scales the ends may be broken.
WxKh6dYTUOU--54,You may not be able to see the zero mark clearly.
WxKh6dYTUOU--55,Figure 10.8A
WxKh6dYTUOU--56,in such cases
WxKh6dYTUOU--57,You should avoid taking measurements from the zero mark of the scale.
WxKh6dYTUOU--58," You can use any other full mark of the scale, say 1.0 cm."
WxKh6dYTUOU--59,Figure 10.8B
WxKh6dYTUOU--60," Then you must subtract the reading of this mark from the reading at the other end. For example,"
WxKh6dYTUOU--61,In figure 10.8B.
WxKh6dYTUOU--62,The reading at one end is...
WxKh6dYTUOU--63,1.0 cm
WxKh6dYTUOU--64,and the other end it is 14.3 cm.
WxKh6dYTUOU--65," Therefore, the length of the object is"
WxKh6dYTUOU--66,14.3 minus 1.0 centimeter is equal to 13.3 centimeter.
WxKh6dYTUOU--67,Figure 10.7 shows method of placing the scale along the length to be measured.
WxKh6dYTUOU--68,E is correct.
WxKh6dYTUOU--69,and figure B is incorrect.
WxKh6dYTUOU--70,Figure 10.8 shows A is incorrect.
WxKh6dYTUOU--71," and figure B is correct method of placing the scale with broken edge. To work so long, be not exactly real."
WxKh6dYTUOU--72,Correct position of the eye is also important for taking measurement.
WxKh6dYTUOU--73,Your eye must be exactly in front of the point where the measurement is to be taken as shown in figure 10.9.
WxKh6dYTUOU--74,Position B is the correct position of the eye.
WxKh6dYTUOU--75," Note that from position B, the reading is 7.5 cm."
WxKh6dYTUOU--76,from positions A and C.
WxKh6dYTUOU--77,The readings may be different. The readings may be different.
WxKh6dYTUOU--78,101
WxKh6dYTUOU--79,Activity 4
WxKh6dYTUOU--80,Measure the height of your classmate using hand span and then by using a meter scale. For this...
WxKh6dYTUOU--81,Ask your classmate to stand with his back against a wall.
WxKh6dYTUOU--82,Make a mark on the wall exactly above his head. Now measure the distance from the floor to this mark on the wall.
WxKh6dYTUOU--83,with your handspan and then with a meter scale.
WxKh6dYTUOU--84,Let all other students measure this length in a similar way.
WxKh6dYTUOU--85,Record all observations in table 10.3.
WxKh6dYTUOU--86,Here is the table 10.3.
WxKh6dYTUOU--87,Measurement of height which is divided into three columns. One is for who measured the height?
WxKh6dYTUOU--88,Second is for height in hand spans.
WxKh6dYTUOU--89,and the third one is for height in centimeter.
WxKh6dYTUOU--90,Now complete this table.
WxKh6dYTUOU--91,Study carefully results obtained by different students.
WxKh6dYTUOU--92,The results in column 2 may be different from each other as the length of the handspan may be different for different students.
WxKh6dYTUOU--93,Look at the results in column 3 where the measurements are done using a standard scale.
WxKh6dYTUOU--94,The results may be close to each other now.
WxKh6dYTUOU--95,But are they exactly equal?
WxKh6dYTUOU--96," If not, why do we think there is a difference?"
WxKh6dYTUOU--97," After all, everybody is using the same scale and not different hand spans."
WxKh6dYTUOU--98,This could be due to small errors in taking observations.
WxKh6dYTUOU--99," In higher classes, we will learn about the importance of knowing and handling such errors in measurement."
WxKh6dYTUOU--100,10.6
WxKh6dYTUOU--101,Measuring the length of a curved line.
WxKh6dYTUOU--102,We cannot measure the length of a curved line directly by using a meter scale.
WxKh6dYTUOU--103,We can use a thread to measure the length of a curved line.
WxKh6dYTUOU--104,Activity 5
WxKh6dYTUOU--105,Use a thread to measure the length of the curved line AB as shown in figure 10.10.
WxKh6dYTUOU--106," Put a knot on the thread near one of its ends, place this knot on the point A. Now a knot on the thread near one of its ends, place this knot on the point A."
WxKh6dYTUOU--107,Place a small portion of the thread along the line. Keeping it taut.
WxKh6dYTUOU--108,using your fingers and thumb.
WxKh6dYTUOU--109,Hold the thread at this end point with one hand.
WxKh6dYTUOU--110," Using the other hand, stretch a little more portion of the thread along the curved line."
WxKh6dYTUOU--111,Figure 10.10 shows measuring the length of a curved line with a thread.
WxKh6dYTUOU--112,Page 103
WxKh6dYTUOU--113,Go on repeating this process till the other end B of the curved line is reached.
WxKh6dYTUOU--114,Make a mark on the thread where it touches the end B.
WxKh6dYTUOU--115,Now stretch the thread along a meter scale.
WxKh6dYTUOU--116,Measure the length between the knot in the beginning and the final mark on the thread.
WxKh6dYTUOU--117,This gives the length of the curved line AB.
WxKh6dYTUOU--118,We see that we need a lot of care to ensure that we are measuring distances and lens correctly.
WxKh6dYTUOU--119,and we need some standard units and devices with which we measure these distances and can convey our results to others.

IpRLdrFqxKk--7,Electricity and Circuits
IpRLdrFqxKk--8," We use electricity for many purposes to make our tasks easier. For example,"
IpRLdrFqxKk--9,We use electricity to operate pumps that lift water from wells or from ground level to the rooftop tank.
IpRLdrFqxKk--10,What are other purposes for which you use electricity?
IpRLdrFqxKk--11,List some of them in your notebook.
IpRLdrFqxKk--12,Does your list include the use of electricity for lighting?
IpRLdrFqxKk--13,Electricity makes it possible to light our homes.
IpRLdrFqxKk--14," Roads, offices, markets and factories even after sunset."
IpRLdrFqxKk--16," The station provides us with electricity. However,"
IpRLdrFqxKk--17,The supply of electricity may fail.
IpRLdrFqxKk--18,or it may not be available at some places.
IpRLdrFqxKk--19," In such situations,"
IpRLdrFqxKk--20,A torch is sometimes used for providing light. A torch has a bulb that lights up when it is switched on.
IpRLdrFqxKk--21,Where does the torch get electricity from?
IpRLdrFqxKk--22,12.1 Electric Cell
IpRLdrFqxKk--23,Electricity to the bulb in a torch is provided by the electric cell.
IpRLdrFqxKk--24," Electric cells are also used in alarm clocks, wristwatches, transistor radios"
IpRLdrFqxKk--25,cameras and many other devices.
IpRLdrFqxKk--26,Have you ever carefully looked at an electric cell?
IpRLdrFqxKk--27,You might have noticed that it has a small metal cap on one side and a metal disc on the other side.
IpRLdrFqxKk--28,Figure 12.1
IpRLdrFqxKk--29,Did you notice a positive sign and a negative sign marked on the electric cell?
IpRLdrFqxKk--30,The metal cap is the positive terminal of the electric cell. The metal disc is the negative terminal.
IpRLdrFqxKk--31," All electric cells have two terminals, a positive terminal that is plus and a negative terminal that is minus."
IpRLdrFqxKk--32,an electric cell produces electricity from the chemicals stored inside it.
IpRLdrFqxKk--33," When the chemicals in the electric cell are used up, the electric cell stops producing electricity."
IpRLdrFqxKk--34,Caution. You might have seen the danger sign shown here displayed on poles.
IpRLdrFqxKk--35,Electric substations and many other places.
IpRLdrFqxKk--36,It is to warn people that electricity can be dangerous if not handled properly.
IpRLdrFqxKk--37,Carelessness in handling electricity and electric devices can cause severe injuries and sometimes even death.
IpRLdrFqxKk--38," Hence, you should never attempt to ."
IpRLdrFqxKk--39,experiment with the electric wires and sockets.
IpRLdrFqxKk--40,Also remember
IpRLdrFqxKk--41,that the electricity generated by portable generators is equally dangerous.
IpRLdrFqxKk--42,Use only electric cells for all activities related to electricity.
IpRLdrFqxKk--43,Page number 117
IpRLdrFqxKk--44,The electric cell then has to be replaced with a new one.
IpRLdrFqxKk--45,A torch bulb has an outer case of glass that is fixed on a metallic base.
IpRLdrFqxKk--46,Figure 12.2a.
IpRLdrFqxKk--47,What is inside the glass case of the bulb?
IpRLdrFqxKk--48,Figuer 12.2a shows a torch bulb and Figure B shows its inside view.
IpRLdrFqxKk--50," That is, a filament."
IpRLdrFqxKk--51,and terminals.
IpRLdrFqxKk--52,Activity 1
IpRLdrFqxKk--53,Take a torch and look inside its bulb.
IpRLdrFqxKk--54,You can also take out the bulb with the help of your teacher.
IpRLdrFqxKk--55,What do you notice?
IpRLdrFqxKk--56,Do you find a thin wire fixed in the middle of the glass bulb?
IpRLdrFqxKk--57,Figure 12.2B
IpRLdrFqxKk--58,Now switch the torch on and observe which part of the bulb is glowing.
IpRLdrFqxKk--59,The thin wire that gives off light is called the filament of the bulb.
IpRLdrFqxKk--60,The filament is fixed to two thicker wires which also provide support to it.
IpRLdrFqxKk--61,as shown in figure 12.2B. One of these thick wires is connected.
IpRLdrFqxKk--62,to the metal case at the base of the bulk.
IpRLdrFqxKk--63,Figure 12.2B
IpRLdrFqxKk--64,The other thick wire is connected to the metal tip at the center of the base.
IpRLdrFqxKk--65,The base of the bulb and the metal tip of the base are the two terminals of the bulb.
IpRLdrFqxKk--66,These two terminals are fixed in such a way that they do not touch each other.
IpRLdrFqxKk--67,The electric bulbs used at home also have similar design.
IpRLdrFqxKk--68," Thus, both the electric cell and the bulb have two terminals each."
IpRLdrFqxKk--69,Why do they have these two terminals?
IpRLdrFqxKk--70,caution
IpRLdrFqxKk--71,Never join the two terminals of the electric cell without connecting them through a switch and a device like a bulb.
IpRLdrFqxKk--72," If you do so, the chemicals in the electric cell get used up very fast and the cell stops working."
IpRLdrFqxKk--73,12.2
IpRLdrFqxKk--74,a bulb connected to an electric cell.
IpRLdrFqxKk--75,Let us try to make an electric bulb light up using an electric cell. How do we do that?
IpRLdrFqxKk--76,Activity 2
IpRLdrFqxKk--77,Take 4 lengths of electric wire with differently colored plastic coverings.
IpRLdrFqxKk--78,Remove a little of the plastic covering from each length of wire at the ends.
IpRLdrFqxKk--79,This would expose the metal wires at the ends of each length.
IpRLdrFqxKk--80,Fix the exposed parts of the wires to the cell.
IpRLdrFqxKk--81,and the bulb as shown in figure.
IpRLdrFqxKk--82,12.3 and figure 12.4
IpRLdrFqxKk--83,Page 118
IpRLdrFqxKk--84,You can stick the wires to the bulb with the tape used by electricians.
IpRLdrFqxKk--85,Use rubber bands or tape to fix the wires to the cell.
IpRLdrFqxKk--86," Now, connect the wires fixed to the bulb with those attached to the cell in 6 different ways."
IpRLdrFqxKk--87,as has been shown in figure 12.5 A to F.
IpRLdrFqxKk--88,For each arrangement find out whether the bulb glows or not.
IpRLdrFqxKk--89,Figure 12.3 Shows
IpRLdrFqxKk--90,Electric cell with two wires attached to it.
IpRLdrFqxKk--91,Figure 12.4 shows.
IpRLdrFqxKk--92,bulb connected to two wires.
IpRLdrFqxKk--93,Figure 12.5 Shows
IpRLdrFqxKk--94,Different arrangements of electric cell
IpRLdrFqxKk--95,and bulb.
IpRLdrFqxKk--96,Right yes or no for each arrangement in your notebook.
IpRLdrFqxKk--97,Now carefully look at the arrangements in which the bulb glows.
IpRLdrFqxKk--98,Compare these with those in which the bulb does not glow.
IpRLdrFqxKk--99,Can you find a reason for the difference?
IpRLdrFqxKk--100,Keep the tip of your pencil on the wire near one terminal of the electric cell for the arrangement in figure 12.5A.
IpRLdrFqxKk--101,Move the pencil along the wire all the way to the bulb. Now
IpRLdrFqxKk--102," from the other terminal of the bulb, move along the other wire connected to the cell."
IpRLdrFqxKk--103,Repeat this exercise for all the other arrangements in Figure 12.5.
IpRLdrFqxKk--104,Did the bulb glow for the arrangements in which you could not move the pencil from one terminal to the other?
IpRLdrFqxKk--105,Page 119
IpRLdrFqxKk--106,12.3
IpRLdrFqxKk--107,an electric circuit.
IpRLdrFqxKk--108,in Activity 2
IpRLdrFqxKk--109,You connected one terminal of the electric cell to the other terminal through wires passing to and from the electric bulb.
IpRLdrFqxKk--111,Note that in the arrangements shown in figure 12.5a and
IpRLdrFqxKk--112,F.
IpRLdrFqxKk--113,The two terminals of the electric cell were connected to two terminals of the bulb.
IpRLdrFqxKk--114,Such an arrangement is an example of an electric circuit. The electric circuit provides a complete path for electricity to pass.
IpRLdrFqxKk--115," That means, current to flow."
IpRLdrFqxKk--116,between the two terminals of the electric cell.
IpRLdrFqxKk--117,The bulb glows only when current flows through the circuit.
IpRLdrFqxKk--118," In an electric circuit, the direction of current is taken to be from the positive to the negative terminal of the electric cell. As shown in figure 12.6"
IpRLdrFqxKk--119,0.6.
IpRLdrFqxKk--120," When the terminals of the bulb are connected with that of the electric cell by wires, the current passes through the filament of the bulb."
IpRLdrFqxKk--121,This makes the bulb glow.
IpRLdrFqxKk--122,Sometimes an electric bulb does not glow even if it is connected to the cell.
IpRLdrFqxKk--123,This may happen if the bulb has fused.
IpRLdrFqxKk--124,Look at a fused bird carefully.
IpRLdrFqxKk--125,Is the filament inside it intact?
IpRLdrFqxKk--126,An electric bulb may fuse due to many reasons.
IpRLdrFqxKk--127," One reason for a bulb to fuse is a break in its filament. A break in the filament of an electric bulb means a break in the path of the current between the terminals of the electric cell. Therefore, a fused bulb does not light up as no current passes through its filament."
IpRLdrFqxKk--128,Can you now explain why the bulb did not glow when you try to do so with the arrangements shown in figure 12.5 B C D and E?
IpRLdrFqxKk--129,Now we know how to make a bulb light up using an electric cell.
IpRLdrFqxKk--130,Would you like to make a torch for yourself?
IpRLdrFqxKk--131,Figure 12.6 shows direction of current in an electric circuit.
IpRLdrFqxKk--132,Activity 3
IpRLdrFqxKk--133,Take a torch bulb and a piece of wire.
IpRLdrFqxKk--134,Remove the plastic covering at the 2 ends of the wire as you did before. Wrap one end of a wire around the base of an electric bulb.
IpRLdrFqxKk--135,Fix the other end of the wire to the negative terminal of an electric cell with a rubber band. Now bring the tip of the base of the bulb that is its other terminal.
IpRLdrFqxKk--136,in contact with the positive terminal of the cell.
IpRLdrFqxKk--137,Figure 12.7. Shows a homemade torch.
IpRLdrFqxKk--138,Page number 120
IpRLdrFqxKk--139,Does a bulb glow.
IpRLdrFqxKk--140,Now move the bulb away from the terminal of the electric cell. Does the bulb remain lighted?
IpRLdrFqxKk--141,Is this not similar to what you do when you switch your torch?
IpRLdrFqxKk--142,on or off.
IpRLdrFqxKk--143,Pahili has another arrangement of the cell and a bulb.
IpRLdrFqxKk--144,Will the torch bulb glow in the following arrangement?
IpRLdrFqxKk--145,12.4 Electric Switch
IpRLdrFqxKk--146,We had an arrangement for switching on or off our homemade torch by moving the base of the bulb away from the tip of the cell.
IpRLdrFqxKk--147," This was a simple switch, but not very easy to use."
IpRLdrFqxKk--148,We can make another simple and easier switch to use in our circuit. Activity 4
IpRLdrFqxKk--149," You can make a switch using two drawing pins, a safety pin or a paper clip."
IpRLdrFqxKk--150,Two wires and a small sheet of thermocol or a wooden board.
IpRLdrFqxKk--151,Insert a drawing pin into the ring at one end of the safety pin and fix it on the thermocol sheet as shown in figure 12.8.
IpRLdrFqxKk--153,Make sure that the safety pin can be rotated freely.
IpRLdrFqxKk--154,Now fix the other drawing pin on the thermocol sheet in a way that the free end of the safety pin can touch it.
IpRLdrFqxKk--155,The safety pin fixed in this way would be your switch in this activity.
IpRLdrFqxKk--156," Now, make a circuit by connecting an electric cell and a bulb with this switch as shown in figure 12.9."
IpRLdrFqxKk--157,Rotate the safety pin so that it's free and touches the other drawing pin.
IpRLdrFqxKk--158,What do you observe?
IpRLdrFqxKk--159,Now move the safety pin away.
IpRLdrFqxKk--160,Does the bulb continue to glow?
IpRLdrFqxKk--161,The safety pin covered the gap between the drawing pins when you made it touch two of them.
IpRLdrFqxKk--162," In this position, the switch is set to be ON."
IpRLdrFqxKk--163,as shown in figure 12.10
IpRLdrFqxKk--164," Since the material of the safe tipin allows the current to pass through it, the circuit was complete, hence the bulb glows."
IpRLdrFqxKk--165,Figure 12.8 shows a simple switch.
IpRLdrFqxKk--166,Figure 12.9 shows an electric circuit with a switch.
IpRLdrFqxKk--167,Figure 12.10 shows a switch in
IpRLdrFqxKk--168,one position.
IpRLdrFqxKk--169,Page 121
IpRLdrFqxKk--170," On the other hand, the bulb did not glow when the safety pin was not in touch with the other drawing pin."
IpRLdrFqxKk--171,The circuit was not complete as there was a gap between the two drawing pins.
IpRLdrFqxKk--172," In this position, the switch is set to be off as in figure 12.9."
IpRLdrFqxKk--173,A switch is a simple device that either breaks the circuit or completes it.
IpRLdrFqxKk--174," The switches used in lighting of electric bulbs and other devices in homes work on the same principle, although their designs are more complex."
IpRLdrFqxKk--176,Boojho has drawn the inside of the torch as in figure 12.11.
IpRLdrFqxKk--177," When we close the switch, the circuit is completed and the bulb glows."
IpRLdrFqxKk--178,Can you draw a red line on the figure indicating the complete circuit? 12.5
IpRLdrFqxKk--179,Electric conductors and insulators.
IpRLdrFqxKk--180,In all our activities we have used metal wires to make a circuit. Suppose we use a cotton...
IpRLdrFqxKk--181,thread instead of a metal wire to make a circuit.
IpRLdrFqxKk--182,Do you think that the bulb will light up in such a circuit?
IpRLdrFqxKk--183,What materials can be used in electric circuits so that the current can pass through them? Let us find out. Activity 5
IpRLdrFqxKk--184,Disconnect the switch from the electric circuit you used for Activity 4. This would leave you with...
IpRLdrFqxKk--185,2 free ends of wires as shown in figure 12.12A.
IpRLdrFqxKk--187,Bring the free ends of the two wires close to let them touch each other. Does the bulb light up?
IpRLdrFqxKk--188,You can now use this arrangement to test whether any given material allows current to pass through it or not.
IpRLdrFqxKk--189,Here is a figure 12.12a
IpRLdrFqxKk--190,A conduction tester.
IpRLdrFqxKk--191," B, testing whether the bulb glows when the tester is in contact with the key."
IpRLdrFqxKk--192,Page 122
IpRLdrFqxKk--193,Collect samples of different types of materials such as coins.
IpRLdrFqxKk--194," cork, rubber"
IpRLdrFqxKk--195," Glass, Keys, Pins"
IpRLdrFqxKk--196," Plastic Scale, Wooden Block"
IpRLdrFqxKk--197," pencil lead, aluminium foil"
IpRLdrFqxKk--198,Candle
IpRLdrFqxKk--199," Sewing Needle, Thermocol"
IpRLdrFqxKk--200,paper and pencil lead.
IpRLdrFqxKk--201,1 by 1 bring the free ends of the wires of your tester in contact with two ends of the samples you have collected.
IpRLdrFqxKk--202,Figure 12.12b
IpRLdrFqxKk--203,Make sure that the two wires do not touch each other while you are doing so.
IpRLdrFqxKk--204,Does the bulb glow in each case?
IpRLdrFqxKk--205,Make a table in your notebook similar to table 12.1 and record your observations.
IpRLdrFqxKk--206," Table 12.1, Conductors and Insulators"
IpRLdrFqxKk--207,There are three columns given in this table. One is for object used in place of the switch. Second is for material it is made of. And the third one is for bulb glows yes or no.
IpRLdrFqxKk--208,The objects are...
IpRLdrFqxKk--209,"key, eraser"
IpRLdrFqxKk--210,scale matchstick
IpRLdrFqxKk--211,"glass bangle, iron nail"
IpRLdrFqxKk--212,Material it is made of
IpRLdrFqxKk--213,metal rubber
IpRLdrFqxKk--214,Plastic Wood
IpRLdrFqxKk--215," Glass, metal respectively."
IpRLdrFqxKk--217," And for the column third, world glows yes or no in first case yes."
IpRLdrFqxKk--218," in second case, no."
IpRLdrFqxKk--219,For rest of the objects complete the table according to your observation.
IpRLdrFqxKk--220,What do you find? The bulb does not glow when the free ends of the wires are in contact with some of the materials you have tested.
IpRLdrFqxKk--221,This means that these materials do not allow the electric current to pass through them.
IpRLdrFqxKk--222," On the other hand, some materials allow electric current to pass through them."
IpRLdrFqxKk--223,which is indicated by the glowing bulb.
IpRLdrFqxKk--224,Materials which allow electric current to pass through them are conductors of electricity.
IpRLdrFqxKk--225,Insulators do not allow electric current to pass through them.
IpRLdrFqxKk--226," With the help of table 12.1, name the materials that are conductors of electricity and also those which are insulators."
IpRLdrFqxKk--228,Conductors
IpRLdrFqxKk--229,blank 1 blank 2 blank 3 insulator blank 1 blank 2 blank 3
IpRLdrFqxKk--230,What do you conclude?
IpRLdrFqxKk--231,which materials are conductors and which are insulators?
IpRLdrFqxKk--232,Recall the objects that we grouped as those having lustre in chapter 4. are they
IpRLdrFqxKk--233," conductors? It now seems easy to understand why copper, aluminum and other metals are used for making wires."
IpRLdrFqxKk--234," Let us recall activity 4 in which we made an electric circuit with a switch, figure 12.9."
IpRLdrFqxKk--235," When the switch was in the open position, were the two drawing pins not connected with each other through the thermocol sheet?"
IpRLdrFqxKk--236,But Thermocol you may have found is an insulator.
IpRLdrFqxKk--237,What about the air between the gap?
IpRLdrFqxKk--238," Since the bulb does not glow, when there is only air in the gap between the drawing pins in your switch. It means that..."
IpRLdrFqxKk--239,Air is also an insulator.
IpRLdrFqxKk--240,Conductors and insulators are 
IpRLdrFqxKk--241,equally important for us.
IpRLdrFqxKk--242," Switches, electric plugs and sockets are made of conductors."
IpRLdrFqxKk--243," On the other hand, rubber and plastics are used for covering electric wires, plug tops, switches and other parts of the"
IpRLdrFqxKk--244,electrical appliances which people might touch.
IpRLdrFqxKk--245," Caution, your body is a conductor of electricity. Therefore, be careful when you handle an electrical appliance."

IpRLdrFqxKk--247,Electric cell is a source of electricity.
IpRLdrFqxKk--248," An electric cell has two terminals. One is called positive, while the other is negative."
IpRLdrFqxKk--249,An electric bulb has a filament that is connected to its terminals.
IpRLdrFqxKk--250,An electric bulb glows when electric current passes through it.
IpRLdrFqxKk--251," In a closed electric circuit, the electric current passes from one terminal of the electric cell to the other terminal. The electric current passes from one terminal of the electric cell to the other terminal."

ovYYEWMtW9M--18,Choosing leaders or rulers by voting is something that has become common during the last 50 years or so.
ovYYEWMtW9M--19,How did men become rulers in the past?
ovYYEWMtW9M--21,Some of the Rajas we read about in Chapter 4.
ovYYEWMtW9M--22,were probably chosen by the Jhana.
ovYYEWMtW9M--23,The people. But around.
ovYYEWMtW9M--24,3001 years ago.
ovYYEWMtW9M--25,We find some changes taking place in the ways in which Rajas were chosen.
ovYYEWMtW9M--26,some men
ovYYEWMtW9M--27,now become recognized as Rajas by performing very big sacrifices.
ovYYEWMtW9M--28,The Ashwamidha or horse sacrifice was one such ritual.
ovYYEWMtW9M--30,A horse was let loose to wander freely.
ovYYEWMtW9M--31,and it was guarded by the Rajas men.
ovYYEWMtW9M--32,If the horse wandered into the kingdoms of
ovYYEWMtW9M--33,other Rajas and they stopped it.
ovYYEWMtW9M--34,They had to fight.
ovYYEWMtW9M--35," If they allowed the horse to pass, it meant..."
ovYYEWMtW9M--36,that they accepted that the Raja who wanted to perform the sacrifice was...
ovYYEWMtW9M--37,stronger than them.
ovYYEWMtW9M--38,These rajas were then invited to the sacrifice. Which was?
ovYYEWMtW9M--39,performed by specially trained priests.
ovYYEWMtW9M--40,who were rewarded with gifts.
ovYYEWMtW9M--41,the Raja who organized the sacrifice was recognized as being very powerful. And all those who came...
ovYYEWMtW9M--42,brought gifts for him.
ovYYEWMtW9M--43,The Raja was a central figure in these rituals.
ovYYEWMtW9M--45," He often had a special seat, a throne."
ovYYEWMtW9M--46,or a tiger skin.
ovYYEWMtW9M--47," His charioteer, who was his companion?"
ovYYEWMtW9M--48," In the battlefield and witnessed his exploits, chanted tales of his glory. Page number"
ovYYEWMtW9M--49," 47. requires relatives, especially"
ovYYEWMtW9M--50,his wives and sons.
ovYYEWMtW9M--51,had to perform a variety of minor rituals.
ovYYEWMtW9M--52,The other Rajas was simply spectators who had to sit.
ovYYEWMtW9M--53,and watch the performance of the sacrifice.
ovYYEWMtW9M--54," The rituals, including the sprinkling of sacred water on the king. The ordinary people."
ovYYEWMtW9M--55,the vish or vaishya
ovYYEWMtW9M--56,also brought gifts however
ovYYEWMtW9M--57," Some people, such as those,"
ovYYEWMtW9M--58,who were regarded as shudras by the priests were excluded from many rituals.
ovYYEWMtW9M--59,Make a list of all those.
ovYYEWMtW9M--60,Who would be present at the sacrifice?
ovYYEWMtW9M--61,which are the categories that are described in terms of their occupation. Varna's.
ovYYEWMtW9M--62,We have many books.
ovYYEWMtW9M--63,that were composed in North India.
ovYYEWMtW9M--64,especially in the areas drained by the Ganga and the Yamuna during this period.
ovYYEWMtW9M--65,These books are often called later Vedic.
ovYYEWMtW9M--66,because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in chapter 4.
ovYYEWMtW9M--68,These include the Samaveda
ovYYEWMtW9M--69,Yajurveda and
ovYYEWMtW9M--70,attarva vida.
ovYYEWMtW9M--71,as well as other books.
ovYYEWMtW9M--72,These were composed by priests.
ovYYEWMtW9M--73,and described how rituals were to be performed.
ovYYEWMtW9M--74,They also contained rules about society.
ovYYEWMtW9M--76,There were several different groups in society.
ovYYEWMtW9M--77,at this time.
ovYYEWMtW9M--78,priests and warriors.
ovYYEWMtW9M--79,farmers
ovYYEWMtW9M--80,herders
ovYYEWMtW9M--81,traders
ovYYEWMtW9M--82,Craft Persons
ovYYEWMtW9M--83,labourers
ovYYEWMtW9M--84,fishing folk and forest people.
ovYYEWMtW9M--86,some priests and warriors were rich.
ovYYEWMtW9M--87,as were some farmers and traders.
ovYYEWMtW9M--88," others, including many herders."
ovYYEWMtW9M--89," craft persons, labourers."
ovYYEWMtW9M--90,fishing folk and hunters and gatherers were poor.
ovYYEWMtW9M--91,The priests divided people into four groups called...
ovYYEWMtW9M--92,Varna's. According to them.
ovYYEWMtW9M--93,Each Varna had a different set of functions.
ovYYEWMtW9M--94,The first Varna was that of the Brahmin.
ovYYEWMtW9M--95,Brahmin's were expected to study and teach.
ovYYEWMtW9M--96,the Vedas. Perform sacrifices.
ovYYEWMtW9M--98,and receive gifts.
ovYYEWMtW9M--99,in the second place were the rulers.
ovYYEWMtW9M--100,also known as kshatriyas.
ovYYEWMtW9M--101,They were expected to fight battles and protect people.
ovYYEWMtW9M--102,Third were the wish or the vashyas.
ovYYEWMtW9M--104," They were expected to be farmers, herders and traders."
ovYYEWMtW9M--105,both the kshatriyas and the vashyas could perform sacrifices.
ovYYEWMtW9M--106,49 Last
ovYYEWMtW9M--107,were the shudras who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often
ovYYEWMtW9M--108,Women were also grouped with the Shudras.
ovYYEWMtW9M--109,Both women and Shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas.
ovYYEWMtW9M--111,The priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth.
ovYYEWMtW9M--112," For example, if..."
ovYYEWMtW9M--113,once father and mother were brahmin.
ovYYEWMtW9M--114,one would automatically become a Brahmin.
ovYYEWMtW9M--115,and so on.
ovYYEWMtW9M--116," Later, they classified some people as untouchable."
ovYYEWMtW9M--117,These included some craftspersons.
ovYYEWMtW9M--118,Hunters and Gatherers.
ovYYEWMtW9M--119," as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priest said,"
ovYYEWMtW9M--120,that contact with these groups was polluting.
ovYYEWMtW9M--121,Many people did not accept the system of Varna.
ovYYEWMtW9M--122,laid down by the Brahmins.
ovYYEWMtW9M--123,Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt...
ovYYEWMtW9M--124,that birth could not be a basis for deciding.
ovYYEWMtW9M--125,which Varna people belonged to.
ovYYEWMtW9M--126," Besides, some people felt..."
ovYYEWMtW9M--127,that there should be no differences amongst people based on...
ovYYEWMtW9M--128,Occupation Others felt
ovYYEWMtW9M--129,that everybody should be able to perform rituals. Then others condemned 
ovYYEWMtW9M--130,the practice of untouchability. Also.
ovYYEWMtW9M--131," There were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the northeast."
ovYYEWMtW9M--132,where social and economic differences were not very sharp and where the influence of the priests was limited.
ovYYEWMtW9M--133,Why did people...
ovYYEWMtW9M--134,Oppose the system of Varna's.
ovYYEWMtW9M--136,Janapadas
ovYYEWMtW9M--137,The Rajas who performed these big sacrifices were now recognized as being...
ovYYEWMtW9M--138,Rajas of Janapadas rather than janas
ovYYEWMtW9M--139,The word janapadha
ovYYEWMtW9M--140,literally means the land where the jhana set its foot.
ovYYEWMtW9M--141,and settle down.
ovYYEWMtW9M--142,Some important Jhanpadas are shown on Map 4.
ovYYEWMtW9M--143,page 49.
ovYYEWMtW9M--144," archaeologists have excavated a number of settlements in these Jhanpadas, such as PuranaQila"

ovYYEWMtW9M--150,They found that people lived in huts.
ovYYEWMtW9M--151,and kept cattle as well as other animals.
ovYYEWMtW9M--152,They also grew a variety of crops.
ovYYEWMtW9M--153," Rice, Wheat,"
ovYYEWMtW9M--154,barley
ovYYEWMtW9M--155,"pulses, sugarcane"
ovYYEWMtW9M--156,sesame and mustard
ovYYEWMtW9M--158,Is there a crop in this list?
ovYYEWMtW9M--159,that was not mentioned in chapter 3.
ovYYEWMtW9M--161,A picture is shown in the left bottom of page number 48.
ovYYEWMtW9M--162,It shows painted grey wear.
ovYYEWMtW9M--163,Plates and bowls are the most common vessels made out of painted greyware.
ovYYEWMtW9M--164,These are extremely fine to touch.
ovYYEWMtW9M--165," with a nice, smooth surface."
ovYYEWMtW9M--166,Perhaps these were used on special occasions.
ovYYEWMtW9M--167,for important people and to serve special food.
ovYYEWMtW9M--168,Page number 49.
ovYYEWMtW9M--169,They made earthen pots.
ovYYEWMtW9M--170,Some of these were grey in colour. Others were red.
ovYYEWMtW9M--171,One special type of pottery found at these sites is known as
ovYYEWMtW9M--172,painted grey wear.
ovYYEWMtW9M--173,"as is obvious from the name, these grey pots"
ovYYEWMtW9M--174,had painted designs.
ovYYEWMtW9M--175," Usually, simple lines."
ovYYEWMtW9M--176,and geometric patterns.

ovYYEWMtW9M--179,Some Jhanpadas became more important than others and were known as Mahajanpadas.
ovYYEWMtW9M--180,Some of these are shown on map 4.
ovYYEWMtW9M--181,Most Mahajanpadas had a capital city.
ovYYEWMtW9M--182,Many of these were fortified.
ovYYEWMtW9M--183,This means that huge walls of wood brick.
ovYYEWMtW9M--184,or stone were built around them.

ovYYEWMtW9M--190,forts were probably built because people.
ovYYEWMtW9M--191,were afraid of attacks from other kings and needed protection.
ovYYEWMtW9M--192,It is also likely that some rulers...
ovYYEWMtW9M--193,wanted to show how rich and powerful they were.
ovYYEWMtW9M--194,by building really large.
ovYYEWMtW9M--195,tall and impressive walls around their cities.
ovYYEWMtW9M--196,also in this way the land and the people.
ovYYEWMtW9M--197,living inside the fortified area.
ovYYEWMtW9M--198,could be controlled more easily by the King.
ovYYEWMtW9M--199,building such huge walls.
ovYYEWMtW9M--200,required a great deal of planning. 1000's...if not...
ovYYEWMtW9M--201,Lacks of bricks or stones had to be prepared.
ovYYEWMtW9M--202,This in turn
ovYYEWMtW9M--203,meant enormous labour.
ovYYEWMtW9M--204," provided possibly by thousands of men, women and children."
ovYYEWMtW9M--205,and resources had to be found for
ovYYEWMtW9M--206,all of this. from this page.

ovYYEWMtW9M--215,The new Rajas now began maintaining armies.
ovYYEWMtW9M--216,Soldiers were paid regular salaries and maintained by the king throughout the year.
ovYYEWMtW9M--218,Some payments were probably made using punchmarked coins.
ovYYEWMtW9M--219,See the illustration on page number 84.
ovYYEWMtW9M--220,You will read more about these coins in chapter number 8.
ovYYEWMtW9M--221,List two ways in which the rajas of the Mahajanpadas were different from those mentioned in the Rigveda.
ovYYEWMtW9M--222,taxes

ovYYEWMtW9M--224,Building huge forts. b 
ovYYEWMtW9M--225,maintaining big armies.
ovYYEWMtW9M--226,They needed more resources.
ovYYEWMtW9M--227,and the needed officials to collect these. So?
ovYYEWMtW9M--228,instead of depending on occasional gifts brought by people.
ovYYEWMtW9M--229," as in the case of the Raja of the Janapadas, they started collecting."
ovYYEWMtW9M--230,Regular taxes.
ovYYEWMtW9M--231,Taxes on crops were the most important.
ovYYEWMtW9M--232,This was because most people were farmers.
ovYYEWMtW9M--233,Usually the tax was fixed at 1.6th of what was produced.
ovYYEWMtW9M--234,This was known as Bhagah or a share.
ovYYEWMtW9M--236, There were taxes on crafts persons as well.
ovYYEWMtW9M--237,These could have been in the form of labour.
ovYYEWMtW9M--238,"For example, a weaver or a smith"
ovYYEWMtW9M--239,may have had to work for a day every month for the king.
ovYYEWMtW9M--241,Herders were also expected to pay taxes in the form of animals and animal produce.
ovYYEWMtW9M--242,They were also taxes on goods.
ovYYEWMtW9M--243,that were brought and sold through trade.
ovYYEWMtW9M--245,and hunters and gatherers also had to provide forest produce.
ovYYEWMtW9M--246,to the Raja.
ovYYEWMtW9M--247,What do you think would have been provided by hunters?
ovYYEWMtW9M--248,and gatherers.

VIowkXsLmYg--24," The farmer's son was still a baby in the cradle, sleeping and crying alternately."
VIowkXsLmYg--25,One day the farmer's wife wanted to go to the market.
VIowkXsLmYg--27,She fed the baby and rocked him to sleep in his...
VIowkXsLmYg--28,little cradle.
VIowkXsLmYg--29," Picking up the basket, she said to her husband, I am off to the bazaar. The baby is sleeping. Keep an eye on him. Frankly,"
VIowkXsLmYg--30,I don't like to leave the child alone with the mongoose.
VIowkXsLmYg--31," You needn't be afraid, say the farmer."
VIowkXsLmYg--32,The Mongos is a friendly animal. It's as sweet as our baby.
VIowkXsLmYg--33,and they are the best friends you know.
VIowkXsLmYg--34,The wife went away and the farmer having nothing to do in the house.
VIowkXsLmYg--35,decided to go out and take a look at his fields not far away.
VIowkXsLmYg--36,He ran into some friends on the way back and didn't return for quite some time.
VIowkXsLmYg--37,Now the synopsis for the rest of the story.

VIowkXsLmYg--39,getting a heavy basket.
VIowkXsLmYg--40,She found the mongoose at the entrance of the house with blood on his face.
VIowkXsLmYg--41,and paws.
VIowkXsLmYg--42," She jumped to the conclusion that it was her son's blood, and the mongos was the guilty one."
VIowkXsLmYg--44,The farmers why finished her shopping and came back home with a basket full of groceries.
VIowkXsLmYg--45,She saw the mongoose sitting outside as if waiting for her.
VIowkXsLmYg--46," on seeing her, he ran to welcome her."
VIowkXsLmYg--47,as was customary
VIowkXsLmYg--48,The farmer's wife took one look at the mongos.
VIowkXsLmYg--49,and screamed blood.
VIowkXsLmYg--50," She cried, the face and paws of the mongoose were smeared with blood."
VIowkXsLmYg--51,You wicked animal! You have killed my baby! She screamed hysterically!
VIowkXsLmYg--52,She was blind with rage and with all her strength brought down the heavy basket full of groceries.
VIowkXsLmYg--53,On the blood-smeared mongoose and ran inside to the child's cradle.
VIowkXsLmYg--54,page number six.
VIowkXsLmYg--55,The baby was fast asleep.
VIowkXsLmYg--56,But on the floor lay a black snake torn and bleeding.
VIowkXsLmYg--57," In a flash, serialized."
VIowkXsLmYg--58,What had happened? She ran out looking for the mongoose.
VIowkXsLmYg--59," Oh, you saved my child."

VIowkXsLmYg--61,What have I done? She cried.
VIowkXsLmYg--62,touching the mongoose who lay it and still.
VIowkXsLmYg--63,unaware of her sobbing.
VIowkXsLmYg--64,The farmer's wife
VIowkXsLmYg--65," who had acted hastily and rashly, still long at the dead Mongols. Then she heard the baby crying. Wiping her tears, she went to feed him."

Nn9spzBqmMs--86," If he sings Raga Deepak, he will die."
Nn9spzBqmMs--87,and we will be rid of him.
Nn9spzBqmMs--88,Shaukat Mian went to Akbar and said.
Nn9spzBqmMs--89,We don't think Tansen is a great singer.
Nn9spzBqmMs--90,Let us test him.
Nn9spzBqmMs--91,Tell him to sing Raga Deepak.
Nn9spzBqmMs--92,Only the greatest singers can sing it properly.
Nn9spzBqmMs--93,Ofcourse he can sing it. Tansen can sing anything Akbar said. Tansen was afraid.
Nn9spzBqmMs--94,but could not disobey the King.
Nn9spzBqmMs--95," Very well, my Lord, he said."
Nn9spzBqmMs--96,but give me time to prepare myself.
Nn9spzBqmMs--97,Tansen went home
Nn9spzBqmMs--98,He had never been more downcast and unhappy. I can sing the raga
Nn9spzBqmMs--99,He told his wife.
Nn9spzBqmMs--100," But the heat it gives off will not only set the lamps alight, it will also burn me to ashes."
Nn9spzBqmMs--102,page number 18

Nn9spzBqmMs--104," If someone sings, raga megh"
Nn9spzBqmMs--105,at the same time and sings it properly.
Nn9spzBqmMs--106,it will bring rain.

Nn9spzBqmMs--108,And her friend Rupvati could do it. He said.
Nn9spzBqmMs--109,He taught the two girls to sing a raga-megh. They practiced.
Nn9spzBqmMs--110,night and day for two weeks.
Nn9spzBqmMs--111,Tansen told them.
Nn9spzBqmMs--112,You must wait till the lamps start.
Nn9spzBqmMs--113,burning and then you start singing.

Nn9spzBqmMs--124,The leaves on the trees dried up and fell to the ground.
Nn9spzBqmMs--125," As the music continued, birds fell dead because of the heat and the water in the rivers began to boil. People cried out in terror."
Nn9spzBqmMs--126,As flames shot up out of nowhere and lighted...
Nn9spzBqmMs--127,the lamps.
Nn9spzBqmMs--128," At once, at once Saraswati and Rupavati began to sing Raga Megh."
Nn9spzBqmMs--129,The sky clouded over and rain came down.
Nn9spzBqmMs--130,Tansen was saved.

YljNks2VsrY--4,Page 66 Body movements
YljNks2VsrY--5,Sit absolutely still.
YljNks2VsrY--6,Observe the movements taking place in your body.
YljNks2VsrY--7,You must be blinking your eyes time to time.
YljNks2VsrY--8,Observe the movements in your body as you breathe.
YljNks2VsrY--9,There are so many movements that happen in our bodies.
YljNks2VsrY--10,When you are writing in your notebook which part of the body are you moving?
YljNks2VsrY--11,Or when you turn and look at your friend.
YljNks2VsrY--12," Different parts of your body move while you remain at the same place. In these examples,"
YljNks2VsrY--13," You also move from one place to another, you get up and go to your teacher or to the school compound or go home after school."
YljNks2VsrY--14," You walk, run."

YljNks2VsrY--16,and move from place to place.
YljNks2VsrY--17,Let us see how animals move from place to place by filling up table 8.1.
YljNks2VsrY--18," After discussing with our friends, teachers and parents."
YljNks2VsrY--19,Bojo wonders about movements in plants.
YljNks2VsrY--20,He knows they do not move from place to place. But do they show any other kind of movements?
YljNks2VsrY--21,Table 8.2
YljNks2VsrY--22,How do animals move from place to place?
YljNks2VsrY--23,There are three columns.
YljNks2VsrY--24,Animal
YljNks2VsrY--25,Body part used for moving from place to place.
YljNks2VsrY--26,How does the animal move? Cow

YljNks2VsrY--41,These are only a few of the ways in which animals move from one place to another.
YljNks2VsrY--42,Why are there so many differences in the way that animals move from place to place?

YljNks2VsrY--44,8.1
YljNks2VsrY--45,human body and its movements.
YljNks2VsrY--46,Let us look closely at some of our own movements to begin with.
YljNks2VsrY--47,before looking at all these varieties of movements in animals.
YljNks2VsrY--48,Do you enjoy doing physical exercise at school?
YljNks2VsrY--49,How do you move your hands and legs while doing different exercises?
YljNks2VsrY--51,Page 68
YljNks2VsrY--52,Let us try some of the many movements our body is capable of.
YljNks2VsrY--54,Ball and imaginary ball at an imaginary wicket.
YljNks2VsrY--55,How did you move your arm?
YljNks2VsrY--56,Did you rotate it at the shoulder in a circular movement?
YljNks2VsrY--57,Did your shoulder also move?
YljNks2VsrY--59,Lie down and rotate your leg at the hip.
YljNks2VsrY--60,Bend your arm at the elbow and the leg at the knee.
YljNks2VsrY--62,Stretch your arms sideways. Bend your arm to touch your shoulder with your fingers.
YljNks2VsrY--63,Which part of your arm did you bend?
YljNks2VsrY--64,Straighten your arm and try to bend it downwards.
YljNks2VsrY--65,Are you able to do it?
YljNks2VsrY--66,Try to move the various parts of your body.
YljNks2VsrY--67,and record their movements in table 8.2.

YljNks2VsrY--80," Rotate partly or turns, yes."
YljNks2VsrY--81,Arm rotates completely.
YljNks2VsrY--82,Yes.
YljNks2VsrY--83," Rest of the table is left blank, fill this table according to your observation."
YljNks2VsrY--84,Why is it that we are able to move a few parts of our body easily in various directions?
YljNks2VsrY--85,and some only in one direction.
YljNks2VsrY--86,Why are we unable to move some parts at all?
YljNks2VsrY--88,Activity 2
YljNks2VsrY--89,Please I scale lengthwise on your arm so that your elbow is in the center.
YljNks2VsrY--90,Figure 8.2
YljNks2VsrY--91,Ask your friend to tie the scale and your arm together.
YljNks2VsrY--92,Now try to bend your elbow.
YljNks2VsrY--93,Are you able to do it?
YljNks2VsrY--94,Figure 8.2
YljNks2VsrY--95," Shos, can you bend your arm now?"
YljNks2VsrY--96,Page 69
YljNks2VsrY--97,Did you notice that we are able to bend or rotate our body in places where two parts of our body seem to be joined together?
YljNks2VsrY--98,Like elbow
YljNks2VsrY--99,shoulder or neck. These places are called joints.
YljNks2VsrY--100,Can you name more such joints?
YljNks2VsrY--101,If our body has no joints
YljNks2VsrY--102,Do you think?
YljNks2VsrY--103,It would be possible for us to move in any way at all.
YljNks2VsrY--104,What exactly is joined together at these joins?
YljNks2VsrY--105,Press your fingers against the top of your head.
YljNks2VsrY--106,Face
YljNks2VsrY--107," neck, nose,"
YljNks2VsrY--108,Here
YljNks2VsrY--109,Back of the shoulder.
YljNks2VsrY--110,Hands
YljNks2VsrY--111,and legs.
YljNks2VsrY--112,including the fingers and toes.
YljNks2VsrY--113,Do you get a feel of something hard pressing against your fingers?
YljNks2VsrY--114,The hard structures are the bones.
YljNks2VsrY--115,Repeat this activity on other parts of your body.
YljNks2VsrY--116,So many bones.
YljNks2VsrY--117,Bones cannot be bent.
YljNks2VsrY--118," So, how do we bend our elbow?"
YljNks2VsrY--119,It is not one long bone from the upper arm to our wrist.
YljNks2VsrY--120,It is different bones joined together at the elbow.
YljNks2VsrY--121," Similarly, there are many bones present in each part of the body."
YljNks2VsrY--122,We can bend or move our body only at those points where bones meet.
YljNks2VsrY--123,There are different types of joints in our body to help us carry out different movements and activities.
YljNks2VsrY--124,Let us learn about some of them.
YljNks2VsrY--125,Ball and socket joints.
YljNks2VsrY--126,Activity 3
YljNks2VsrY--127,Roll a strip of paper into a cylinder.
YljNks2VsrY--128,Make a small hole in an old rubber of plastic ball under supervision.
YljNks2VsrY--129,and push the paper cylinder into it as shown in figure 8.2.
YljNks2VsrY--130,You can also stick the cylinder on the ball.
YljNks2VsrY--131,Put the ball in a small bowl.
YljNks2VsrY--132,Figure 8.2 shows making a ball and socket joint.
YljNks2VsrY--133,Does the ball rotate freely inside the bowl?
YljNks2VsrY--134,Does the paper cylinder also rotate?
YljNks2VsrY--135,Now imagine that the paper cylinder is your arm and the ball is its...
YljNks2VsrY--136,end.
YljNks2VsrY--137,The bowl is like the part of the shoulder to which your arm is joined.
YljNks2VsrY--138,The rounded end of one bone fits into the cavity.
YljNks2VsrY--139,Hollow space of the other bone.
YljNks2VsrY--140,Figur 8.4
YljNks2VsrY--141,Such a joint allows movements in all directions. Can you name another...
YljNks2VsrY--142,"such joint, you can think of..."
YljNks2VsrY--143,Re-collecting the body movements we tried at the beginning of this section.
YljNks2VsrY--145," Figure 8.3 shows a ball and socket joint including hip bone, ball and socket joint thigh bone."
YljNks2VsrY--146,Pivotal joint
YljNks2VsrY--147,The joint where our neck joints the head is a pivotal joint. Figure 8.4.
YljNks2VsrY--149,It allows us to bend our head forward and backward.
YljNks2VsrY--150,and turn the head to our right or left. Try these movements.
YljNks2VsrY--152,How are these movements different from those of our arm that can rotate a complete circle in its ball and socket joint?
YljNks2VsrY--153," In a pivotal joint, a cylindrical bone rotates in a ring."
YljNks2VsrY--155,Figure 8.5
YljNks2VsrY--156,Page 70
YljNks2VsrY--157,Hinder joints.
YljNks2VsrY--158,Open and close a door a few times.
YljNks2VsrY--159,Observe the hinges of the door carefully.
YljNks2VsrY--160,They allow the door to move back and forth.
YljNks2VsrY--161,Activity 4
YljNks2VsrY--162,Let us look at the kind of movement allowed by a hinge.
YljNks2VsrY--163," Make a cylinder, with cardboard & Thick Chart Paper"
YljNks2VsrY--164,as shown in figure 8.6
YljNks2VsrY--165,Attach a small pencil to the cylinder by piercing the cylinder at the center as shown.
YljNks2VsrY--166,Make a hollow half cylinder from cardboard.
YljNks2VsrY--167,such that.
YljNks2VsrY--168,The rolled up cylinder can fit inside it easily.
YljNks2VsrY--169,The hollow half cylinder with the rolled up cylinder sitting inside it allows movement like a hinge.
YljNks2VsrY--170,Try to move the rolled up cylinder.
YljNks2VsrY--171,How does it move?
YljNks2VsrY--172,How is this movement different from what we saw with our constructed ball and socket joint?
YljNks2VsrY--173,We saw this kind of movement at the elbow in Activity 1.
YljNks2VsrY--174,What we have constructed in figure 8.5 is different from a hinge of course.
YljNks2VsrY--175,But it illustrates the direction in which a hinge allows movement.
YljNks2VsrY--176,The elbow has a hint of joint that allows only a back and forth movement.
YljNks2VsrY--177,Figure 8.7
YljNks2VsrY--178,Can you think of more examples of such joints?
YljNks2VsrY--179,Figure 8.6 shows hen joints of the knee.

dPuKX_lM4Zc--95," The second column says, how the shapes would look after."
dPuKX_lM4Zc--96,The second column would tell how the shape would look on one fourth turn.
dPuKX_lM4Zc--97,and the third column tells us how the shape would look on half turn.
dPuKX_lM4Zc--98,Which of the above shapes do not look the same on one fourth?
dPuKX_lM4Zc--99,Turn!
dPuKX_lM4Zc--100,Which shapes do not look the same on half a turn?. Given below we have two fans.
dPuKX_lM4Zc--101,They are identical except for the color of one of the blades in the second one.
dPuKX_lM4Zc--102," The question is, which fan will look the same on a one third turn?"

dPuKX_lM4Zc--120,The first one has the different shapes.
dPuKX_lM4Zc--121,The second column tells us how they will look on one third turn and the third column is about how they will look on.
dPuKX_lM4Zc--122,1-6th turn. for the teacher
dPuKX_lM4Zc--123,Encourage children to look at the figure and see what kind of a symmetry is there. If the need they can draw six lines to see how to rotate a figure through one sixth turn.
dPuKX_lM4Zc--124," They should also be able to see that a figure which looks the same on 1-6th turn will also look the same on 1-3rd turn, which is the same as 2-1-6th turns."
dPuKX_lM4Zc--125,page 86. 2.
dPuKX_lM4Zc--126,Look at the following shapes.

BTqVQCBPUzg--9,She asked each child of her class about one favorite pet animal. She used...
BTqVQCBPUzg--10,Tally marks to record each answer.
BTqVQCBPUzg--11," For example, if someone said, cat."
BTqVQCBPUzg--12,She put one line.
BTqVQCBPUzg--13,in front of cats.
BTqVQCBPUzg--14," When someone said, cat again, she added a line."
BTqVQCBPUzg--15," So, another line added means two cats."
BTqVQCBPUzg--16,and a box with a diagonal line means 5 cats.
BTqVQCBPUzg--17," In all, 24 children said Cat was their favorite animal."
BTqVQCBPUzg--18,Help yamini complete the table.
BTqVQCBPUzg--19,We have a table with three columns.

BTqVQCBPUzg--25,Cats
BTqVQCBPUzg--26,We have 5 boxes in which 4 have been diagonally cut. The fifth one is just the outline.
BTqVQCBPUzg--27,So that means the number is
BTqVQCBPUzg--28,5 plus 5
BTqVQCBPUzg--29,plus 5 plus 5 plus 4
BTqVQCBPUzg--30,That is 24.

BTqVQCBPUzg--137,Ragini loves to watch cartoons on television.
BTqVQCBPUzg--138,One day she thought of counting the number of ads during the breaks.
BTqVQCBPUzg--139,She found that in each break there were 14 advertisements.
BTqVQCBPUzg--140," In 10 of those ads, there were children as actors."
BTqVQCBPUzg--142,Below this is a picture of Ragini.
BTqVQCBPUzg--143,Watching television and counting the number of ads during the breaks.
BTqVQCBPUzg--144,Why do you think that children are used in so many ads?
BTqVQCBPUzg--145,Use tallymarks to count the number of ads during a short break in a program.
BTqVQCBPUzg--146,Were there ads during the news program?
BTqVQCBPUzg--147,Try yourself.

myIXH3PjvoI--2,How many squares in me?
myIXH3PjvoI--3,On the page we have some pictures.
myIXH3PjvoI--4,The first one is a conversation between a boy and a girl.
myIXH3PjvoI--6,we see a rectangular figure between them which is created by two squares on top of the other.
myIXH3PjvoI--7," The figure is cut diagonally from the top right to the bottom left corner, creating two triangles."
myIXH3PjvoI--8,The girl on the left is asking
myIXH3PjvoI--9,What is the area of this triangle?
myIXH3PjvoI--10," The boy is telling, the triangle is half the rectangle of area 2 square centimeters."
myIXH3PjvoI--11,So its area is dash square centimeters.
myIXH3PjvoI--12,Below that we have another conversation between a boy and a girl.
myIXH3PjvoI--13,In between them we see...
myIXH3PjvoI--14,a big rectangle in which
myIXH3PjvoI--15,There is a shape of curves drawn.
myIXH3PjvoI--16,The girl is asking
myIXH3PjvoI--17,Is this shape half of the big rectangle?
myIXH3PjvoI--18," The boy is thinking, hmmm."
myIXH3PjvoI--19,So its area is dash square centimeters. Question.
myIXH3PjvoI--20,Write the area in square centimeters of the shapes given.
myIXH3PjvoI--21," Again we see the picture of a huge grid, created by many squares."
myIXH3PjvoI--22,Within these grid lines we see a lot of geometrical figures.
myIXH3PjvoI--23,drawn and marked as.
myIXH3PjvoI--24," A, B, C, D, E and F."
myIXH3PjvoI--25,for the teacher.
myIXH3PjvoI--26,In this exercise children are expected to notice the geometrical symmetry of the shapes to find out their area.
myIXH3PjvoI--27,encourage children to evolve their own strategies.
myIXH3PjvoI--28,Rounding off is not needed in these examples.
myIXH3PjvoI--29,page 41.
myIXH3PjvoI--30,try triangles
myIXH3PjvoI--31,On top of the page we see a grid line structure as the base on which two triangles are drawn.
myIXH3PjvoI--32,1 blue in color and 1 red.
myIXH3PjvoI--33,a girl Sameena
myIXH3PjvoI--34,and the boy sadiq
myIXH3PjvoI--35,Both are looking at these triangles.
myIXH3PjvoI--36,Sameena says
myIXH3PjvoI--37,Both the big triangles in this rectangle have the same area.
myIXH3PjvoI--38," Sadiq is thinking, but these look very different."
myIXH3PjvoI--39,Sadiq says
myIXH3PjvoI--40," Sadiq continues by saying, the blue triangle is half of the big rectangle."
myIXH3PjvoI--41,Area of the big rectangle is 20 square centimeters.
myIXH3PjvoI--42,So the area of the blue triangle is...... dash square centimeters. Sameena asks...
myIXH3PjvoI--43,And what about the red triangle?
myIXH3PjvoI--44,Sadiq replies. Ah.
myIXH3PjvoI--45,In it there are two halves of two different rectangles.
myIXH3PjvoI--46,and then we see a bird on the bottom right of the page telling us.
myIXH3PjvoI--47,Now you find the area of the two rectangles Sadiq is talking about.
myIXH3PjvoI--48,What is the area of the red triangle?
myIXH3PjvoI--49,explain
myIXH3PjvoI--50,page 42.
myIXH3PjvoI--51," Sadiq says, yes, you are right."
myIXH3PjvoI--52,and you know what?
myIXH3PjvoI--53,You can draw many more triangles of area 10 square centimeters in this rectangle.
myIXH3PjvoI--54,Try drawing them.
myIXH3PjvoI--55,help Sadiq in finding some more such triangles.
myIXH3PjvoI--57,Draw at least five more.
myIXH3PjvoI--58,Complete the shape.
myIXH3PjvoI--59,Suruchi drew two sides of a shape.
myIXH3PjvoI--61,She asked Asif to complete the shape with two more sides.
myIXH3PjvoI--62,so that its area is 10 square centimeters.
myIXH3PjvoI--64,We have two pictures.
myIXH3PjvoI--65,On the left side there is a grid line structure of squares in which
myIXH3PjvoI--66,An incomplete figure has been drawn by Suruchi.
myIXH3PjvoI--67,the top of a triangle perhaps?
myIXH3PjvoI--68,And on the right side we see the same figure being completed by Asif. He joined the two lower ends of the figure to create another triangle downwards.
myIXH3PjvoI--69,He completed the shape like this.
myIXH3PjvoI--70," Suruchi asks, how did you do this?"
myIXH3PjvoI--71,"Asif replies, oh that's easy. If you look at the green area,"
myIXH3PjvoI--72,It is 4 square centimeters.
myIXH3PjvoI--73,Below it is the yellow area of 6 square centimeters.
myIXH3PjvoI--74,So the area of my shape is 10 square centimeters.
myIXH3PjvoI--75,Questions? Is he correct?
myIXH3PjvoI--76,Discuss. Questions explain.
myIXH3PjvoI--77,How the green area is 4 square centimeters?
myIXH3PjvoI--78,and the yellow area is 6 square centimeters.
myIXH3PjvoI--79,page 43.
myIXH3PjvoI--80,On the top of the page we again see Suruchi and Asif conversing.
myIXH3PjvoI--81," This time, Suruchi has drawn the bottom triangle in a different way."
myIXH3PjvoI--82,which is present here in blue color.
myIXH3PjvoI--84,Suruchi's telling Asif...
myIXH3PjvoI--85," Oh, I thought of doing it differently."
myIXH3PjvoI--86," If you draw like this, the area is still 10 square centimeters. Questions?"
myIXH3PjvoI--87,Is Suruchi correct?
myIXH3PjvoI--88,How much is the blue area?
myIXH3PjvoI--89,Can you think of some other ways of completing the shape?
myIXH3PjvoI--90,Try some other ways yourself.
myIXH3PjvoI--91,Now ask your friends at home to solve these.
myIXH3PjvoI--92,We see the picture of a girl next to the questions.
myIXH3PjvoI--93,thinking to herself.
myIXH3PjvoI--94," Every time guests come home, I ask them to do this. But why do they run away?"
myIXH3PjvoI--95,Practice time.
myIXH3PjvoI--96,1
myIXH3PjvoI--97,This is one of the sides of a shape.
myIXH3PjvoI--98,Complete the shape so that it's area is 4 square centimeters.
myIXH3PjvoI--99,to the right side of the question we see a square grid.
myIXH3PjvoI--100,with one sloping line drawn. 2
myIXH3PjvoI--101,Two sides of a shape are drawn here.
myIXH3PjvoI--102,Complete the shape by drawing two more sides so that it's area is less than 2 square centimeters.
myIXH3PjvoI--103,On the left side of the question we see again a square grid.
myIXH3PjvoI--104,with two sloping lines drawn.
myIXH3PjvoI--105,which are meeting at the top.
myIXH3PjvoI--106,like the point of a triangle.
myIXH3PjvoI--107,for the teacher.
myIXH3PjvoI--108,Children can be encouraged to make shapes with either straight edges or curved edges to cover the given area.
myIXH3PjvoI--109,This exercise can be extended by asking children to draw on squared paper.
myIXH3PjvoI--110,as many shapes as they can of a given area and making guesses for the largest
myIXH3PjvoI--111,or the smallest perimeter.
myIXH3PjvoI--112,They can also be asked to check their guesses by measuring the dimensions of the shapes.
myIXH3PjvoI--113," In case of curved edges, thread can be used for measuring the perimeter."
myIXH3PjvoI--114,page 44. 3.
myIXH3PjvoI--115,Here is a rectangle of area 20 square centimeters.
myIXH3PjvoI--116," Below this we see two rows of squares, one on top of the other."
myIXH3PjvoI--117," Question, part A."
myIXH3PjvoI--118,Draw one straight line in this rectangle to divide it into two equal triangles.
myIXH3PjvoI--119,What is the area of each of the triangles?
myIXH3PjvoI--120,Part B.
myIXH3PjvoI--121,Draw one straight line in this rectangle to divide it into two equal rectangles.
myIXH3PjvoI--122,what is the area of each of the smaller rectangles? of the large rectangles killing two between space contract.
myIXH3PjvoI--123,Draw two straight lines in this rectangle to divide it into one rectangle and two equal triangles.
myIXH3PjvoI--125,What is the area of the rectangle?
myIXH3PjvoI--126,what is the area of each of the triangles.

LljUaUMMCdg--1,Properties of Materials
LljUaUMMCdg--2,You
LljUaUMMCdg--3,Have you ever wondered why a tumbler is not made with a piece of cloth?
LljUaUMMCdg--4," Recall our experiments with pieces of cloth in chapter 3 and also keep in mind that we generally use a tumbler to keep a liquid. Therefore, would it"
LljUaUMMCdg--5," Not be silly, if we were to make a tumbler out of cloth."
LljUaUMMCdg--6,Figure 4.2
LljUaUMMCdg--7," What we need for a tumbler is glass, plastics,"
LljUaUMMCdg--8,Metal or other such material that will hold
LljUaUMMCdg--9,water.
LljUaUMMCdg--10," Similarly, it would not be wise to use paper-like materials for cooking vessels."
LljUaUMMCdg--11,Here in figure 4.2 a cloth tumbler is shown which is not able to keep water in it. And the water keeps pouring out.
LljUaUMMCdg--13,We see then that we choose a material to make an object depending on its properties and the purpose for which the object is to be used.
LljUaUMMCdg--14," So, what are all the properties of materials that would be important for their usage? Some properties are discussed here. Appearance."
LljUaUMMCdg--16,Materials usually look different from each other.
LljUaUMMCdg--17,Wood looks very different from iron.
LljUaUMMCdg--18,iron appears different from copper or aluminium.
LljUaUMMCdg--19," At the same time, there may be some similarities between iron, copper,"
LljUaUMMCdg--20,and aluminium that are not there in wood
LljUaUMMCdg--21,Activity 3
LljUaUMMCdg--22,Collect small pieces of different materials.
LljUaUMMCdg--23," Paper, Cardboard"
LljUaUMMCdg--24,Wood.
LljUaUMMCdg--25,Copper wire
LljUaUMMCdg--26,Aluminium sheet chalk
LljUaUMMCdg--27,Do any of these appear shiny?
LljUaUMMCdg--28,Separate the shiny materials into a group.
LljUaUMMCdg--29," Now, observe as the teacher cuts each material into two pieces."
LljUaUMMCdg--30,and look at the freshly cut
LljUaUMMCdg--31,surface
LljUaUMMCdg--32,as shown in figure 4.3.
LljUaUMMCdg--33,What do you notice?
LljUaUMMCdg--34,Does the freshly cut surface of some of these materials appear shiny?
LljUaUMMCdg--35,Include these objects also in the group of shiny materials.
LljUaUMMCdg--36,Do you notice such a shine or lustre in the other materials?
LljUaUMMCdg--37,Cut them anyway as you can.
LljUaUMMCdg--38,Repeat this in the class with as many materials as possible and make a list of those with and without luster.
LljUaUMMCdg--39," Instead of cutting, you can rub the surface of material with sandpaper to see if it has less friction."
LljUaUMMCdg--40,Figure 4.3 Shows
LljUaUMMCdg--41,Cutting pieces of materials to see if they have luster.
LljUaUMMCdg--42,Page 29
LljUaUMMCdg--43,Materials that have such luster are usually metals.
LljUaUMMCdg--44,Iron Copper Aluminium
LljUaUMMCdg--45,and gold are examples of metals.
LljUaUMMCdg--46,Some metals often lose their shine and appear dull.
LljUaUMMCdg--47,because of the action of air and moisture on them.
LljUaUMMCdg--48,We therefore notice the lusture
LljUaUMMCdg--49,only on their freshly cut surface.
LljUaUMMCdg--50," When you visit an ironsmith or a workshop, look out for freshly cut surfaces of metal rods to see if they have lustre."
LljUaUMMCdg--51,Hardness
LljUaUMMCdg--52," When you press different materials with your hands,"
LljUaUMMCdg--53,Some of them may be hard to compress.
LljUaUMMCdg--54,while others can be easily compressed.
LljUaUMMCdg--55,Take a metal key and try to scratch with it.
LljUaUMMCdg--56," the surface of a piece of wood, aluminum, a piece of stone, a nail,"
LljUaUMMCdg--57,"Candle, chalk"
LljUaUMMCdg--58,any other material or object
LljUaUMMCdg--59,You can easily scratch some materials.
LljUaUMMCdg--60,while some cannot be scratched so easily.
LljUaUMMCdg--61,Materials which can be compressed or scratched easily are called soft.
LljUaUMMCdg--62,while some other materials
LljUaUMMCdg--63,which are difficult to compress are called hard.
LljUaUMMCdg--64,for example cotton or
LljUaUMMCdg--65,sponge is soft.
LljUaUMMCdg--66,while iron is hard.
LljUaUMMCdg--67," In appearance, materials can have different properties."
LljUaUMMCdg--68," Like, Lustre, Hardness"
LljUaUMMCdg--69,be rough or smooth
LljUaUMMCdg--70,Can you think of other properties that describe the appearance of a material?
LljUaUMMCdg--71,soluble or insoluble
LljUaUMMCdg--72,Activity 4.
LljUaUMMCdg--73,Collect samples of some solid substances.
LljUaUMMCdg--74," such as sugar, salt,"
LljUaUMMCdg--75,Chalk Powder Sand and sawdust
LljUaUMMCdg--76,Take 5 glasses
LljUaUMMCdg--77,or beakers.
LljUaUMMCdg--78,Fill each one of them about 2-thirds with water.
LljUaUMMCdg--79,Add a small amount of spoonful of sugar to the first glass.
LljUaUMMCdg--80,Soil to the second and similarly
LljUaUMMCdg--81,add small amounts of the other substances into the other...
LljUaUMMCdg--82,glasses
LljUaUMMCdg--83,Stir the contents of each of them with a spoon.
LljUaUMMCdg--84,Wait for a few minutes.
LljUaUMMCdg--85,Observe what happens to the substances added to water?
LljUaUMMCdg--86,Note your observations as shown in table 4.3.
LljUaUMMCdg--87,Figure 4.4 shows what disappears and what doesn't.
LljUaUMMCdg--88,Table 4.3 mixing different solid materials in water.
LljUaUMMCdg--89," There are two columns, one is for substance and the other four disappears in water or does not disappear."
LljUaUMMCdg--90,salt
LljUaUMMCdg--91,Disappear completely in water.
LljUaUMMCdg--92,sugar
LljUaUMMCdg--93," Substances like sugar, sand, chalk powder and saw dust"
LljUaUMMCdg--94,Complete this table.
LljUaUMMCdg--95,by observing the activity.
LljUaUMMCdg--96,You will notice that some substances have completely disappeared or dissolved in water.
LljUaUMMCdg--97,We say that these substances are soluble in water.
LljUaUMMCdg--98,Other substances do not mix with water and do not disappear even after we stir for a long time.
LljUaUMMCdg--99,These substances are insoluble in water.
LljUaUMMCdg--100,Page 30 Water plays an important role in the functioning of our body.
LljUaUMMCdg--101,because it can dissolve a large number of substances.
LljUaUMMCdg--102,Do liquids also dissolve in water.
LljUaUMMCdg--103,Activity 5
LljUaUMMCdg--104,Collect samples of vinegar.
LljUaUMMCdg--105,Lemon juice
LljUaUMMCdg--106,Muster Oil & Coconut Oil
LljUaUMMCdg--107,Caryocene or any other liquid
LljUaUMMCdg--108," Take a glass tumbler, fill it up to half with water."
LljUaUMMCdg--109,At a few spoonfuls of 1 liquid to this and stir it well.
LljUaUMMCdg--110,Let it stand for 5 minutes.
LljUaUMMCdg--111," Observe, whether the liquid mixes with water?"
LljUaUMMCdg--112,Fugure 4.5.
LljUaUMMCdg--113,Repeat the same with other liquids as many different.
LljUaUMMCdg--114,liquids as are available to you.
LljUaUMMCdg--115,Write your observations in table 4.4.
LljUaUMMCdg--116,Figger 4.5A
LljUaUMMCdg--117,Shows some liquids mix well with water while figure 4.5B shows some others do not.

LljUaUMMCdg--124,lemon juice mustard oil
LljUaUMMCdg--126,"coconut oil, kerosine"
LljUaUMMCdg--127,These are left for you. Observe the activity and complete the table.
LljUaUMMCdg--128,We notice that some liquids get completely mixed with water.
LljUaUMMCdg--129,Some others do not mix with water and form a separate layer.
LljUaUMMCdg--130,when kept aside for some time.
LljUaUMMCdg--131,boojho suggests
LljUaUMMCdg--132,That we also check if the liquids that we used in Activity 5 mix well with some liquid other than water.
LljUaUMMCdg--133,Paheli is curious to know whether gas is also dissolved in water?
LljUaUMMCdg--134," Some gases are soluble in water, whereas others are not."
LljUaUMMCdg--135," Water usually has small quantities of some gases dissolved in it. For example,"
LljUaUMMCdg--136,Oxygen gas dissolved in water is very important for the survival of animals and plants that live in water.
LljUaUMMCdg--137,Objects may float or sink in water.
LljUaUMMCdg--138," While doing activity 4, you might have noticed that"
LljUaUMMCdg--139,The insoluble solids separated out from water.
LljUaUMMCdg--140,You may have also noticed this with some liquids in Activity 5.
LljUaUMMCdg--141,Some of these materials that did not mix with water floated to the surface of water.
LljUaUMMCdg--142," Others may have sunk to the bottom of the tumbler, right? We notice many examples of objects that float in water or sink."
LljUaUMMCdg--143,figure 4.6
LljUaUMMCdg--144,Dry leaves falling on the surface of a pond.
LljUaUMMCdg--145,A stone that you throw into this pond.
LljUaUMMCdg--146,Few drops of honey that you let fall into a glass of water. What happens to all of these?
LljUaUMMCdg--147,Page 31
LljUaUMMCdg--148,Figure 4.6 shows some objects float in water while others sink in it.
LljUaUMMCdg--149,boojho would like you to give him five examples each of objects that float and those that sink in water.
LljUaUMMCdg--150,What about testing these same materials to see if they float or sink in other liquids like oil?
LljUaUMMCdg--151,Transparency
LljUaUMMCdg--152,You might have played the game of hide and seek.
LljUaUMMCdg--153,Think of some places where you would like to hide so that you are not seen by others.
LljUaUMMCdg--154,Why did you choose those places?
LljUaUMMCdg--155," Would you have tried to hide behind a glass window? Obviously not, as your friends can see through that and spot you."
LljUaUMMCdg--156,Can you see through all the materials? Those substances or materials through which...
LljUaUMMCdg--157,things can be seen are called transparent.
LljUaUMMCdg--158,Figure 4.7
LljUaUMMCdg--159," which shows looking through opaque, transparent or translucent material."
LljUaUMMCdg--160," Glass, water, air and some plastics are examples of transparent materials."
LljUaUMMCdg--161," Shopkeepers usually prefer to keep biscuits, sweets and other eatables in transparent containers of glass or plastic."
LljUaUMMCdg--162,so that buyers can easily see these items as shown in figure 4.8.
LljUaUMMCdg--163," On the other hand, there are some materials through which you are not able to see."
LljUaUMMCdg--164,These materials are called opaque. You cannot tell what is kept.
LljUaUMMCdg--165," in a closed wooden box, a cardboard carton or a metal container."
LljUaUMMCdg--166,Cardboard and matters are examples of opaque
LljUaUMMCdg--167,materials.
LljUaUMMCdg--168,Do we find that we can group all materials and objects without any confusion as either opaque or transparent?
LljUaUMMCdg--169,Figure 4.8 chose.
LljUaUMMCdg--170,Transparent bottles in a shop.
LljUaUMMCdg--171,Activity 6
LljUaUMMCdg--172,Take a sheet of paper and look through it towards a lighted bulb.
LljUaUMMCdg--173,Make a note of your observation.
LljUaUMMCdg--174,Now put two or three drops of some oil and spread it on the sheet of paper.
LljUaUMMCdg--175,Page 32
LljUaUMMCdg--176,Look again towards the lighted bulb through that portion of the paper on which the oil has been spread.
LljUaUMMCdg--177,Do you find that the bulb is more clearly visible than before?
LljUaUMMCdg--178,But can you see clearly through the oil paper?
LljUaUMMCdg--179,Is everything on the other side of it visible?
LljUaUMMCdg--180,Perhaps not.
LljUaUMMCdg--181,The materials through which objects can be seen but not clearly are known as translucent.
LljUaUMMCdg--182,Remember the oily patch on paper when we tested food items for presence of fats?
LljUaUMMCdg--183,That was translucent
LljUaUMMCdg--184,Can you think of some more examples of translucent materials? We can therefore group the...
LljUaUMMCdg--185," materials as opaque, transparent and translucent."
LljUaUMMCdg--186,Paheli suggests covering the glass of a torch with your palm at a dark place.
LljUaUMMCdg--187,Switch on the torch and observe the other side of the palm. She wants to know.
LljUaUMMCdg--188,"whether palm of your hand is opaque, transparent or translucent."
LljUaUMMCdg--189," Figure 4.9, shows."
LljUaUMMCdg--190,Does torch light pass through your palm?
LljUaUMMCdg--191,We learnt that materials differ in their appearance and the way they mix in water or other liquids.
LljUaUMMCdg--192," They may float or sink in water or may be transparent, opaque or translucent."
LljUaUMMCdg--193,Materials can be grouped on the basis of similarities or differences in their properties.
LljUaUMMCdg--194,Why do we need to group materials?
LljUaUMMCdg--195," In everyday life, we often group materials for our convenience."
LljUaUMMCdg--196," At home, we usually store things in such a manner that similar objects are placed together."
LljUaUMMCdg--197,Such an arrangement helps us to locate them easily.
LljUaUMMCdg--198," Similarly, a grocer usually keeps all type of biscuits at one corner of his shop."
LljUaUMMCdg--199,All soaps at another while grains and pulses are stored at some other place.
LljUaUMMCdg--200,There is another reason why we find such grouping useful.
LljUaUMMCdg--201,You
LljUaUMMCdg--202,Dividing materials in groups makes it convenient to study their properties and also observe any patterns in these properties. We will study more about this in higher classes.

zuuFlJktQAA--11,If you find out the population of your city or town
zuuFlJktQAA--12,Can you now estimate the number of buckets of garbage?
zuuFlJktQAA--13,that may be generated in a day in your city or town.
zuuFlJktQAA--14,We are generating mountains of garbage everyday.
zuuFlJktQAA--15,Isn't it?

zuuFlJktQAA--18,Let us read a story about a village.
zuuFlJktQAA--19,where there is less garbage and more wisdom.
zuuFlJktQAA--20,nanu studys in class VI
zuuFlJktQAA--21,He is very fond of making paper planes. His mother is very annoyed.
zuuFlJktQAA--22,When he tears off sheets from new notebooks to make aeroplanes.
zuuFlJktQAA--23,But Nanu does not care. Once
zuuFlJktQAA--24,Nanu went to his aunt's village
zuuFlJktQAA--25,along with his mother.

zuuFlJktQAA--44,said nani
zuuFlJktQAA--45,and added
zuuFlJktQAA--46,Would you like to learn this from me?
zuuFlJktQAA--47,Nanu was not very keen and ran outside to play.
zuuFlJktQAA--48,He was only interested in tearing up papers.
zuuFlJktQAA--49,to make planes.
zuuFlJktQAA--50," In fact, he also started tearing up papers from Shyam's files"
zuuFlJktQAA--51,Shyam collected all the pieces of paper Nanu had used.
zuuFlJktQAA--52,wondering what to do about him.

zuuFlJktQAA--59,the shopkeeper for a polythene bag to keep the hats.
zuuFlJktQAA--60,who gave him a paper bag instead of polythene.
zuuFlJktQAA--61,Nano also bought many other items.
zuuFlJktQAA--62,Like biscuits & toffee
zuuFlJktQAA--63,He found it difficult to carry all of these things as no shopkeeper was ready to give a polythene bag.
zuuFlJktQAA--65,Shyam had told him to carry a cloth bag with him and he was sorry he did not listen to him.
zuuFlJktQAA--66,Somehow he managed to reach home with all his purchases.

zuuFlJktQAA--80,How different his town was from Shams village? There were no rag
zuuFlJktQAA--81,pickers in the village as it was neat and clean. But now.
zuuFlJktQAA--82,He stopped making faces when he saw the rag
zuuFlJktQAA--83,picking children near his house. You might have seen some children.

zuuFlJktQAA--107,notebooks
zuuFlJktQAA--108,Or any other paper.
zuuFlJktQAA--109,Do not use shiny plastic coated paper.
zuuFlJktQAA--110,You will also need a frame fitted with a wire mesh or a net.
zuuFlJktQAA--111,You can also use a large sized sieve in place of a frame.
zuuFlJktQAA--112,tear the paper into small pieces.
zuuFlJktQAA--113,Put them in a tub or a bucket.
zuuFlJktQAA--114,and pour water in it.
zuuFlJktQAA--115,Let the pieces of paper remain submerged in water for a day.
zuuFlJktQAA--116,Make a thick paste of paper by pounding it.
zuuFlJktQAA--117,Now spread the wet paste on the wire mesh fixed to the frame.
zuuFlJktQAA--118,Pat it gently to make the thickness of layer of the paste as uniform as possible.
zuuFlJktQAA--119,Wait till water drains off.
zuuFlJktQAA--120,if required.
zuuFlJktQAA--121,Spread an old cloth.
zuuFlJktQAA--122,or a sheet of newspaper on the paste.
zuuFlJktQAA--123,to let it soak up the extra water.
zuuFlJktQAA--124,Page 162.
zuuFlJktQAA--125," Now, carefully remove the layer of paste from the frame."
zuuFlJktQAA--126,Spread it on a sheet of newspaper in the sun.
zuuFlJktQAA--127,Keep the corners of the newspaper sheet.
zuuFlJktQAA--128,pressed by putting some weights so that these do not curl up.
zuuFlJktQAA--129,You can add food colour.
zuuFlJktQAA--130,or flower petals.
zuuFlJktQAA--131,pieces of dry leaves.
zuuFlJktQAA--132,or pieces of colored paper in the paste before spreading it.
zuuFlJktQAA--133,It would help you to get a recycled paper with beautiful patterns on it.
zuuFlJktQAA--134,Can we recycle everything just as we recycle paper?
zuuFlJktQAA--135,16.5 plastics
zuuFlJktQAA--136,boon or a curse
zuuFlJktQAA--137,Some kind of plastics can be recycled but...
zuuFlJktQAA--138,not all of them.
zuuFlJktQAA--139,Did you notice that polythene bags and some plastics did not rot in Activity 1?
zuuFlJktQAA--140,You might now easily understand why polythene bags create big problem in garbage disposal.
zuuFlJktQAA--141,It may be a little difficult to imagine or live without plastics.
zuuFlJktQAA--142,Shall we list a few things we use that are made of plastics?
zuuFlJktQAA--143,toys shoes
zuuFlJktQAA--144,"Bags, tooth Brushes"
zuuFlJktQAA--145," Combs, water pipes."
zuuFlJktQAA--146,Bottles

zuuFlJktQAA--150,"bus, scooter"
zuuFlJktQAA--151," refrigerator, radio, television,"
zuuFlJktQAA--152,that are made of plastics.
zuuFlJktQAA--153,The use of plastics in itself might not create so much of a problem.
zuuFlJktQAA--154,Problems arise when we use plastics excessively.
zuuFlJktQAA--155,and are ignorant about ways of disposing their waste.
zuuFlJktQAA--156,This is what is happening all around us.
zuuFlJktQAA--157,We might even be acting irresponsibly knowing well about its harmful effects.
zuuFlJktQAA--158,We often use plastic bags to store cooked food items. Sometimes these bags may not be suitable for keeping eatables.
zuuFlJktQAA--159,Consuming food packed in such plastic bags could be harm...
zuuFlJktQAA--160,...ful to our health
zuuFlJktQAA--161,Many a time shopkeepers use plastic bags.
zuuFlJktQAA--162,that have been used earlier for some other purpose.
zuuFlJktQAA--163," Sometimes, backs collected by drag pickers are also used after washing them."
zuuFlJktQAA--164,Use of such recycled plastic bags to keep food items could be harmful for our health.
zuuFlJktQAA--165," For storing eatables, we must insist on use of plastic bags that..."
zuuFlJktQAA--166,are approved for such a use.
zuuFlJktQAA--167,All kind of plastics give out harmful gases upon heating or burning.
zuuFlJktQAA--168,These gases may cause many health problems.
zuuFlJktQAA--169,including cancer in humans.
zuuFlJktQAA--170,The government has also laid down guidelines for recycling of plastics.
zuuFlJktQAA--171,Paheli would like to suggest.
zuuFlJktQAA--172,that containers used for storing poisonous substances.
zuuFlJktQAA--173,shoud be recycled separately
zuuFlJktQAA--174,and that such recycled plastics are not used to make plastic bags.
zuuFlJktQAA--175,You must have noticed that people often fill garbage in plastic bags and then throw it away.
zuuFlJktQAA--176," When stray animals look for food in these bags, they end up swallowing these. Sometimes..."
zuuFlJktQAA--177,They die due to this.
zuuFlJktQAA--178,The plastic bags thrown away carelessly on roads and other places.
zuuFlJktQAA--179,Get into drains.
zuuFlJktQAA--180,and the sewers system.

7CuBSDLjfIo--192,Does the colour appear in the stem?
7CuBSDLjfIo--193,You will find that
7CuBSDLjfIo--194,The color rises in the stem.
7CuBSDLjfIo--195," If this is kept for a longer period,"
7CuBSDLjfIo--196,the color appears in the viens of the leaves also
7CuBSDLjfIo--197,How do you think?
7CuBSDLjfIo--198,the color reached there?
7CuBSDLjfIo--199,Page 55
7CuBSDLjfIo--200,From this activity.
7CuBSDLjfIo--201,We see that.
7CuBSDLjfIo--202,The stem helps in upward movement of water.
7CuBSDLjfIo--203,The water and minerals
7CuBSDLjfIo--204,Go to leaves and other plant parts attached to the stem.
7CuBSDLjfIo--205," Figure 7.6 shows, stem in a glass with coloured water."
7CuBSDLjfIo--206,Figure 7.7A shows.

7CuBSDLjfIo--220,the part of leaf.
7CuBSDLjfIo--221," By which it is attached to the stem,"
7CuBSDLjfIo--222,is called petiole
7CuBSDLjfIo--223,The broad
7CuBSDLjfIo--224,Green part of the leaf.
7CuBSDLjfIo--225,is called Lemina.
7CuBSDLjfIo--226,Figure 7.8
7CuBSDLjfIo--227,can you identify
7CuBSDLjfIo--228,These parts of the leaves in plants around you?
7CuBSDLjfIo--229,Do all the leaves have petioles?
7CuBSDLjfIo--230,Let us get to know the leaf better by taking its impression.
7CuBSDLjfIo--231,If you thought that leaves cannot sign...
7CuBSDLjfIo--232,Here is an activity which will make you think again.
7CuBSDLjfIo--233,Figure 7.8 chose.
7CuBSDLjfIo--234," Different parts of leaf, lamina, stem and petiole."
7CuBSDLjfIo--235,Activity 3
7CuBSDLjfIo--236,Put a leaf under a wide sheet of paper
7CuBSDLjfIo--237,or a sheet in your notebook.
7CuBSDLjfIo--238,Hold it in place as shown in figure 7.9.
7CuBSDLjfIo--239,Hold your pencil tip sideways and rub it on the portion of the paper having the leaf below it.
7CuBSDLjfIo--240,Did you get an impression with some lines in it?
7CuBSDLjfIo--241,Are they similar to those on the leaf?
7CuBSDLjfIo--242,These lines on the leaf.
7CuBSDLjfIo--243,are called veins
7CuBSDLjfIo--244,Do you see a prominent line?
7CuBSDLjfIo--245,in the middle of the leaf.
7CuBSDLjfIo--246,This is called the mid-rib.
7CuBSDLjfIo--247,The design made by veins in a leaf is called
7CuBSDLjfIo--248,Leave Venatian
7CuBSDLjfIo--249,If this design is net like on both sides of mid-rib
7CuBSDLjfIo--250,the venation is reticulate
7CuBSDLjfIo--251,Figure 7.10A
7CuBSDLjfIo--252,in the leaves of grass.
7CuBSDLjfIo--253,You might have seen that the veins are parallel to one another.
7CuBSDLjfIo--254,Thank you.
7CuBSDLjfIo--255,This is Parallel Venetian.
7CuBSDLjfIo--256,Figure 7.10B
7CuBSDLjfIo--257,Observe the Venatian in as many leaves as you can without removing them from the plant.
7CuBSDLjfIo--258,and
7CuBSDLjfIo--259,Right names of some plants having reticulate and parallel venation.

dht7S24Zauk--11,and keep it also in the sun.
dht7S24Zauk--12,After a few hours
dht7S24Zauk--13,Observe the inner surface of the covers
dht7S24Zauk--14,What do you see?
dht7S24Zauk--15,Are there any droplets of water?
dht7S24Zauk--16,How do you think they got there?
dht7S24Zauk--17,Don't forget to remove the polythene bag.
dht7S24Zauk--18,after the activity.
dht7S24Zauk--19,Water comes out of leaves.
dht7S24Zauk--20,...in the form of vapour...
dht7S24Zauk--21,by a process called transpiration.
dht7S24Zauk--22,Plants release a lot of water into the air.
dht7S24Zauk--23,Through this process.
dht7S24Zauk--24,Why do we tie a cover around the leaves?
dht7S24Zauk--25,Would we have seen?
dht7S24Zauk--26,The water evaporate if we had not tied a polythene cover.
dht7S24Zauk--27,What makes the water appear on the polythene bag?
dht7S24Zauk--28,In Chapter 5 we noticed water changing into different forms in some of our activities.
dht7S24Zauk--29,Can you think of these and name the process that makes?
dht7S24Zauk--30,What are the drops appear on the polythene cover?
dht7S24Zauk--31,Leaves also have another function. Let us study this.
dht7S24Zauk--32,Figure 7.11
dht7S24Zauk--33,What does the leaf do?
dht7S24Zauk--34,Activity 5
dht7S24Zauk--35,We will require a leaf

dht7S24Zauk--47,Note
dht7S24Zauk--48,Since the activity involves...
dht7S24Zauk--49,the use of spirit and heating.
dht7S24Zauk--50,It is advised that it is demonstrated by the teacher in the class.
dht7S24Zauk--51,Now place the test
dht7S24Zauk--52,tube in a beaker
dht7S24Zauk--53,half filled with water
dht7S24Zauk--54,Heat the beaker till all the green colour from the leaf comes out into the spirit in the test tube.
dht7S24Zauk--55,Take out the leaf carefully.
dht7S24Zauk--56,and wash it in water.
dht7S24Zauk--57,Place it on a watch glass.
dht7S24Zauk--58,and pour some iodine solution over it.
dht7S24Zauk--59,Figure 7.12
dht7S24Zauk--60,What do you observe?
dht7S24Zauk--61,Compare your observations with those done in chapter.
dht7S24Zauk--62,2
dht7S24Zauk--63,when you tested food
dht7S24Zauk--64,for presents of different nutrients.
dht7S24Zauk--65,Does this mean that the leaf has...
dht7S24Zauk--66,starch in it
dht7S24Zauk--67," In chapter 2, we saw that"
dht7S24Zauk--68,A slice of raw potato also shows the presence of starch.
dht7S24Zauk--69,But at those get this touch.
dht7S24Zauk--70,from their leaves and store it.
dht7S24Zauk--71,Leaves prepare their food
dht7S24Zauk--72,in the presence of sunlight.
dht7S24Zauk--73,and a green colored substance present in them.
dht7S24Zauk--74," For this, they also use water."
dht7S24Zauk--75,and carbon dioxide.
dht7S24Zauk--76,This process is called photosynthesis. This process is called photosynthesis.
dht7S24Zauk--77,Oxygen is given out in this process.
dht7S24Zauk--78,The food prepared by leaves ultimately
dht7S24Zauk--79,Get stored in different parts of plant.
dht7S24Zauk--80,We have seen
dht7S24Zauk--81,that the stem supplies leaf with water.
dht7S24Zauk--82,The leaf uses the water to make food.
dht7S24Zauk--83,Thank you.
dht7S24Zauk--84,the leaves also lose water through transpiration.
dht7S24Zauk--85,How do they stem and leaves get water?
dht7S24Zauk--86,that is where the roots come in.
dht7S24Zauk--87,7.4

dht7S24Zauk--89,Look at figures 7.13.
dht7S24Zauk--90,Who do you think is watering their plant correctly?
dht7S24Zauk--91,"Paheli or Bhujo, why?"
dht7S24Zauk--92,which part of the plant is in the soil.
dht7S24Zauk--93,Let us learn more about this part from the following activities.
dht7S24Zauk--94," Figure 7.13, watering the plants."
dht7S24Zauk--95,Activity 6
dht7S24Zauk--96,You would require...

dht7S24Zauk--99,Khurpey for digging
dht7S24Zauk--100,Blade or a pair of scissors
dht7S24Zauk--101,and water.
dht7S24Zauk--102,This activity is to be done in groups of four or five students.
dht7S24Zauk--103,Select two plants of the same kind.
dht7S24Zauk--104,From an open ground
dht7S24Zauk--105,and dig them out with roots.
dht7S24Zauk--106,Take care that their roots do not break.
dht7S24Zauk--107,Thank you.
dht7S24Zauk--108,Plant one of them in pot E.
dht7S24Zauk--109,As shown in figure 7.14
dht7S24Zauk--110,A
dht7S24Zauk--111,Cut off the roots from the other plant.
dht7S24Zauk--112,and plant it in pot B.
dht7S24Zauk--113,as shown in figure 7.14b.
dht7S24Zauk--114,Figure 7.14A plant with roots and figure 7.14B without roots.
dht7S24Zauk--115,page 58.
dht7S24Zauk--116,Water them regularly.
dht7S24Zauk--117,Observe the plants after a week.
dht7S24Zauk--118,are both plants healthy
dht7S24Zauk--119,Both the plants are watered regularly.
dht7S24Zauk--120," But one is without roots, isn't it?"
dht7S24Zauk--121,Does this activity help you understand an important function of the root?
dht7S24Zauk--122,Let us do an activity to study another function of root.
dht7S24Zauk--123,Activity 7
dht7S24Zauk--124,We would require
dht7S24Zauk--125,Seeds of gram and maize.
dht7S24Zauk--126,cotton wool cotton wool
dht7S24Zauk--127,and some water.
dht7S24Zauk--128,Take two cutories.
dht7S24Zauk--129,Place some wet cotton in them.
dht7S24Zauk--130,Put 3 or 4 seeds of gram in one and maze in the other.
dht7S24Zauk--131,Keep the cotton wet by sprinkling water every day.
dht7S24Zauk--132,until the sprouts have grown into young plants.
dht7S24Zauk--133,After a week
dht7S24Zauk--134,Try to separate the young plants from the cotton.
dht7S24Zauk--135,Figure 7.15
dht7S24Zauk--136,Was it easy to separate the cotton from the roots?
dht7S24Zauk--137,Why?
dht7S24Zauk--138,in Activity 6.
dht7S24Zauk--139," We could not pull out the plants from the soil, right?"
dht7S24Zauk--140,We dug them out.
dht7S24Zauk--141,This is because...
dht7S24Zauk--142,Roots help in holding the plant.
dht7S24Zauk--143,Firmly to the side
dht7S24Zauk--144,They anchor the plant to the soil.
dht7S24Zauk--145,You have seen that there are different kinds of stems and leaves.
dht7S24Zauk--146,Do the roots also show a variety? Let us find out.

qGFwpI6VRbE--4,Chapter 13
qGFwpI6VRbE--5,Ways to multiply and divide.
qGFwpI6VRbE--6," Maniratnam, the cashier."
qGFwpI6VRbE--7,You
qGFwpI6VRbE--8,Manirhatnam is the cashier of King Jayan.
qGFwpI6VRbE--9,His job is to find out the salary of all the people who work for the king.
qGFwpI6VRbE--10,This chart shows how much salary each person gets in a day.
qGFwpI6VRbE--11,We have a table with two columns.
qGFwpI6VRbE--12,column 1 states person.
qGFwpI6VRbE--13,and column 2 gives us salary in a day.
qGFwpI6VRbE--14,It reads as follows. Minister?
qGFwpI6VRbE--15,Rupes 195?
qGFwpI6VRbE--16,Horse Rider Rupees 76. Look. Cook!
qGFwpI6VRbE--17,Rupees 65
qGFwpI6VRbE--18,Manirattnam wanted to calculate the salary of the cook for the month of January.
qGFwpI6VRbE--19,He wrote...
qGFwpI6VRbE--20,Rupees 1800
qGFwpI6VRbE--21,plus 150
qGFwpI6VRbE--22,plus 60.
qGFwpI6VRbE--23,plus 5. is equal to Rup...
qGFwpI6VRbE--24,...pes dash
qGFwpI6VRbE--25,We see a picture of Maniratnam the cashier on the page.
qGFwpI6VRbE--26,and he is looking busy doing his work.
qGFwpI6VRbE--27,We also see another table of calculations.
qGFwpI6VRbE--28,Observe it carefully to understand how things work.
qGFwpI6VRbE--29," Maniratnam's daughter, Bela, has learned another method to multiply."
qGFwpI6VRbE--30,She wrote like this.
qGFwpI6VRbE--31,and showed it to Banu her brother.
qGFwpI6VRbE--33,Below this is a picture of Bela and Banu.
qGFwpI6VRbE--34," Banu asks, Akka, how did you do this?"
qGFwpI6VRbE--35,Bela tells him.
qGFwpI6VRbE--36,We can multiply 65 with 31 in two steps.
qGFwpI6VRbE--37,We know 31 is 30 plus 1.
qGFwpI6VRbE--38,So first multiply 65 with 1.
qGFwpI6VRbE--39,and then with 30.
qGFwpI6VRbE--40,In between we see the entire calculation being done.
qGFwpI6VRbE--41,page 171.
qGFwpI6VRbE--42," Now, Banu tried to find the salary of a minister for the month of January."
qGFwpI6VRbE--43,He wanted to multiply 195 by 31.
qGFwpI6VRbE--45,The calculation is shown on the left side and Banu is explaining us how he multiplied.
qGFwpI6VRbE--46,He says
qGFwpI6VRbE--47," To multiply by 30, I first write a 0 here."
qGFwpI6VRbE--48,Then I only have to multiply by 3.
qGFwpI6VRbE--49,Practice time. 1.
qGFwpI6VRbE--50,Use Bela's method to multiply these numbers. Hey!
qGFwpI6VRbE--51,32 by 46 B
qGFwpI6VRbE--52,67 by 18
qGFwpI6VRbE--53,We have two different boxes in which the calculation has been started for you.
qGFwpI6VRbE--54, Observe it carefully and also look at the breakup of numbers to make things easy. 2
qGFwpI6VRbE--55,Do these in your notebook using Bela's method. A.
qGFwpI6VRbE--56,47 multiplied by 19 B
qGFwpI6VRbE--57,188 multiplied by 91 c
qGFwpI6VRbE--58," 63 multiplied by 57, D"
qGFwpI6VRbE--59,225 multiplied by 22 E
qGFwpI6VRbE--60,316 multiplied by 12 and F.
qGFwpI6VRbE--61,163 multiplied by 42.
qGFwpI6VRbE--62,page 172
qGFwpI6VRbE--63,Shanta Ram
qGFwpI6VRbE--64,a special cook.
qGFwpI6VRbE--65,Shanta Ram is a special cook.
qGFwpI6VRbE--66,who comes only on party days.
qGFwpI6VRbE--67,Last year he was called for only 28 days.
qGFwpI6VRbE--68," For each day, he has to be paid Rupees 165."
qGFwpI6VRbE--69,Find out how much money he will get in all.
qGFwpI6VRbE--70," If he is called for all days of the year, how much salary will he get?"
qGFwpI6VRbE--71,After this we have the calculations for this. The box is colored green.
qGFwpI6VRbE--72," We have the number 165 written on top, and that is to be multiplied by 365, which is written in the next row."
qGFwpI6VRbE--73,Notice the breakdown of the bigger numbers to make things easier.
qGFwpI6VRbE--74,Now find the salaries of the minister and horse rider for one year.
qGFwpI6VRbE--75,years and years Hey
qGFwpI6VRbE--76," So, hunt drinks 8 glasses of water every day."
qGFwpI6VRbE--77,How many glasses will he drink in one month?
qGFwpI6VRbE--78,–
qGFwpI6VRbE--79,How many glasses will he drink in one year?
qGFwpI6VRbE--80," If 125 people living in a colony drink 8 glasses of water in a day,"
qGFwpI6VRbE--81,How much water will the drink in a year?
qGFwpI6VRbE--82,below this we see a colony of people
qGFwpI6VRbE--83,and lots of glasses have also been piled one over the other.
qGFwpI6VRbE--84,To the extreme right corner we see a bird sitting on one of the glasses.
qGFwpI6VRbE--85,and he's asking us.
qGFwpI6VRbE--86,Can you guess how many glasses of drinking water are used in a day in your colony?
qGFwpI6VRbE--87,page 173.
qGFwpI6VRbE--88,If Soha's heart beats 72 times in one minute?
qGFwpI6VRbE--89,How many times does it beat in one hour?
qGFwpI6VRbE--90,Now find out how many times it beats in one day.
qGFwpI6VRbE--91,Count your own heartbeat to find out how many times your heartbeat is in one week. And here we have another bird.
qGFwpI6VRbE--92,Asking us.
qGFwpI6VRbE--93,Guess how many times it beats in one year? –
qGFwpI6VRbE--94,A baby elephant drinks around 12 litres of milk every day.
qGFwpI6VRbE--95,How much milk will it drink in two years?
qGFwpI6VRbE--96,We have the picture of a baby elephant drinking milk from a container.
qGFwpI6VRbE--97,A baby blue whale drinks around 200 litres of milk in one day.
qGFwpI6VRbE--98,Just imagine how much milk that is.
qGFwpI6VRbE--99,Find out in how many days your family would use 200 liters milk.
qGFwpI6VRbE--100,How much milk would the baby blue whale drink in 8 months?
qGFwpI6VRbE--101,Next to it on the right side we have the picture of a baby blue whale.
qGFwpI6VRbE--102,Karunnya.
qGFwpI6VRbE--103,The Land Lord.
qGFwpI6VRbE--104,Karunnya bought three fields.
qGFwpI6VRbE--105," There's a picture of Karunnya in a box with three different fields marked as field A, field B and field C."
qGFwpI6VRbE--106,The dimensions of all the sides are also mentioned on each of the fields.
qGFwpI6VRbE--107,Field A is 27 meters by 28 meters. Field B is 27 meters.
qGFwpI6VRbE--108,36m x 12m Filt C is
qGFwpI6VRbE--109,27 meters by 19 meters.
qGFwpI6VRbE--110,Page 174
qGFwpI6VRbE--111,Find the area of all the three fields.
qGFwpI6VRbE--112,field A
qGFwpI6VRbE--113,dash square meters field b
qGFwpI6VRbE--114,dash square meters field C
qGFwpI6VRbE--115,dash square meters.
qGFwpI6VRbE--116,He bought Field A at the rate of rupees 95 for a square meter.
qGFwpI6VRbE--117," Field B, at rupees 110 for a square meter."
qGFwpI6VRbE--118,and field C at rupees 120 for a square meter.
qGFwpI6VRbE--119,Find the cost of all three fields.
qGFwpI6VRbE--120,The wise bird we often meet has come up again and is asking us.
qGFwpI6VRbE--121," Hmm, did he spend more than a lakh of rupees?"
qGFwpI6VRbE--122,Tulsi and her husband work on Karunya's farm.
qGFwpI6VRbE--123,The government has said that farm workers should be paid at least Rs 71 for one day's work.
qGFwpI6VRbE--124,But he pays Rs 55 to Tulsi.
qGFwpI6VRbE--125,and rupees 58 to her husband.
qGFwpI6VRbE--126," If the Tulsi works for 49 days,"
qGFwpI6VRbE--127,How much money does she get?
qGFwpI6VRbE--128,dash.
qGFwpI6VRbE--129," If her husband works for 42 days, how much money does he get?"
qGFwpI6VRbE--130,dash
qGFwpI6VRbE--131,Find the money they earn together.
qGFwpI6VRbE--133,Dash
qGFwpI6VRbE--134,We also see a picture of Tulsi and her husband on the left side of the page.
qGFwpI6VRbE--135," A pair of birds is seen at the bottom of the page, asking us something."
qGFwpI6VRbE--136,but one says...
qGFwpI6VRbE--137," Oh, he does not give them the minimum wage?"
qGFwpI6VRbE--139," But, too says..."
qGFwpI6VRbE--140,And why does he pay less to Tulsi and more to her husband?
qGFwpI6VRbE--141,discuss.
qGFwpI6VRbE--142,Page 175
qGFwpI6VRbE--143,Tulsi is telling her husband in the picture.
qGFwpI6VRbE--144,I saw this in the newspaper.
qGFwpI6VRbE--145,Governments of different states have said that farm workers should not be paid less than this salary for a day's work.
qGFwpI6VRbE--146,We have a table with two columns.
qGFwpI6VRbE--147,Column 1 heading is state.
qGFwpI6VRbE--148,Column 2 heading is Salary for one day.
qGFwpI6VRbE--149,Let's read the table row wise.
qGFwpI6VRbE--150," Haryana, Rupees 135."
qGFwpI6VRbE--151," Rajasthan, Rupees 73."
qGFwpI6VRbE--152," Madhya Pradesh, Rupees 97, and orissa"
qGFwpI6VRbE--153,Rupees 75
qGFwpI6VRbE--154,The table shows the amounts fixed by 4 states.
qGFwpI6VRbE--155," For farm work, which state has fixed the highest amount."
qGFwpI6VRbE--156,which state has fixed the lowest? B
qGFwpI6VRbE--157,Bhairon Singh is a worker in Rajasthan.
qGFwpI6VRbE--158,If he works for 8 weeks on the farm
qGFwpI6VRbE--159,How much will he earn? C
qGFwpI6VRbE--160,Neelam is a worker in Haryana.
qGFwpI6VRbE--161," If she works for 2.5 months on the farm,"
qGFwpI6VRbE--162,How much will she earn? D
qGFwpI6VRbE--163,How much more will a farm worker in Madhya Pradesh get than a worker in Orissa after working for nine weeks?
qGFwpI6VRbE--164," farmers in Vidarbha, Maharashtra."
qGFwpI6VRbE--165,On the bottom of the page we see two newspaper reports. One of them reads.
qGFwpI6VRbE--167,Vidarbha is facing a very serious problem.
qGFwpI6VRbE--169,There was no rain and crops failed.
qGFwpI6VRbE--170,Many farmers were unhappy.
qGFwpI6VRbE--171,Some farmers even ended their own lives.
qGFwpI6VRbE--172,A newspaper reporter went around the area and spoke to the people.
qGFwpI6VRbE--173,He wrote these two reports.
exqm_484F14--0,9.4
exqm_484F14--1,Characteristics of Organisms Page 87
exqm_484F14--2,We went on a journey.
exqm_484F14--3,Through different habitats and discussed many plants and animals. In Activity 1
exqm_484F14--4," We listed objects, plants and animals"
exqm_484F14--5,found in different surroundings.
exqm_484F14--6,Suppose we stop a while and think.
exqm_484F14--7,Which examples in our list are living?
exqm_484F14--8,Let us think of examples from a forest.
exqm_484F14--9," trees, creepers"
exqm_484F14--10," small and big animals, birds, snakes,"
exqm_484F14--11," insects, rocks"
exqm_484F14--12," soil, water"
exqm_484F14--13,air dry leaves
exqm_484F14--14," dead animals, mushrooms and moss."
exqm_484F14--15,Maybe only some of the objects that are present in the forest.
exqm_484F14--16,which of these are living?
exqm_484F14--17,Think of objects that you can see around you at this moment?
exqm_484F14--18,and group them as living and non-living.
exqm_484F14--19," In some cases, it is easy for us to know. For example,"
exqm_484F14--20,We know that objects like chair or table are not alive.
exqm_484F14--21,Paheli was reading this rhyme from Complete Nonsense written by Edward Lear.
exqm_484F14--22," Said the table to the chair, you can hardly be aware."
exqm_484F14--23,How I suffer from the heat?
exqm_484F14--24,and from chilblains on my feet
exqm_484F14--25,If we took a little walk
exqm_484F14--26,We might have a little talk.
exqm_484F14--27,Pray let us take the air
exqm_484F14--28,Said the table to the chair.
exqm_484F14--29,Said the chair to the table.
exqm_484F14--30,Now you know we are not able?
exqm_484F14--31,How foolishly you talk.
exqm_484F14--32,When you know we cannot walk.
exqm_484F14--33,Set the table with a sigh.
exqm_484F14--34,It can do no harm to try.
exqm_484F14--35,I have as many legs as you.
exqm_484F14--36,Why can't we walk on two?
exqm_484F14--37,Paheli and boojho found the poem very funny.
exqm_484F14--38,because they knew that a chair or a table is not alive.
exqm_484F14--39,"and it cannot talk or walk. Chair, table"
exqm_484F14--41,we do know
exqm_484F14--42,that we are alive.
exqm_484F14--43,and so are all the people of the world.
exqm_484F14--44,We also see animals around us that are so full of life.
exqm_484F14--45,"Dogs, cats."
exqm_484F14--46," monkeys, squirrels"
exqm_484F14--47,insects and many others.
exqm_484F14--48,How do we know that something is living? Often.
exqm_484F14--49,It is not so easy to decide.
exqm_484F14--50,We are told that plants are living.
exqm_484F14--51,But they do not move like a dog or a pigeon.
exqm_484F14--52,"On the other hand, a car or a bus can move."
exqm_484F14--53,Still we consider them as non-living.
exqm_484F14--54," Plants and animals appear to grow in size with time. But then, at times,"
exqm_484F14--55,Clouds in the sky also seem to grow in size.
exqm_484F14--56,Does it mean that clouds are living?
exqm_484F14--57,No. So?
exqm_484F14--58,How does one distinguish between living and non-living things?
exqm_484F14--59,Do living things have some common characteristics that make them?
exqm_484F14--60,Very different from the non-living.
exqm_484F14--61,You are a wonderful example of a living being.
exqm_484F14--62,What characteristics do you have?
exqm_484F14--63,which make you different from a non-living thing. List a few of these characteristics.
exqm_484F14--64,in your notebook.
exqm_484F14--65,Look at your list and mark!
exqm_484F14--66,Those characteristics that you have listed
exqm_484F14--67,which may also be found in animals or plants.
exqm_484F14--68,Some of these characteristics are perhaps common to all living things. Page 88
exqm_484F14--69,Do all organisms need food?
exqm_484F14--70,In chapters 1 and 2 we learn
exqm_484F14--71,that all living things need food and how essential it is to animals and to us.
exqm_484F14--72,We have also learnt that plants make their own food by the process of
exqm_484F14--73,Photosynthesis
exqm_484F14--74,Animals depend on plants or other animals for their food.
exqm_484F14--75,Ford gives organisms the energy needed for them to grow.
exqm_484F14--76,Organisms also need energy for other life processes that go on inside them.
exqm_484F14--77,Do all organisms show growth?
exqm_484F14--78,Does the Kurtha you had 4 years back still fit you?
exqm_484F14--79," You cannot wear it anymore, isn't it?"
exqm_484F14--80,You must have grown taller during these years.
exqm_484F14--81,You may not realize it but you are growing all the time and in few more years you will become an adult.
exqm_484F14--82,Figure 9.10
exqm_484F14--83,Young ones of animals also grow into adults.
exqm_484F14--84,You would surely have noticed pubs grow into adults.
exqm_484F14--85,a chick hatched from an egg
exqm_484F14--86,Grows into a hen or a cock.
exqm_484F14--87,Figure 9.11
exqm_484F14--88,PLANTS ALSO GROW
exqm_484F14--89,Look around you and see a few plants of a particular type. Some are very small and young.
exqm_484F14--90,Some are bigger
exqm_484F14--91,They may all be in different stages of growth.
exqm_484F14--92,Look at the plants after a few days and weeks.
exqm_484F14--93,You may find that some of them have grown in size.
exqm_484F14--94,Growth seems to be common to all living things.
exqm_484F14--95,Do you think non-living things show growth? Figure 9.10 shows.
exqm_484F14--96,a baby grows into an adult.
exqm_484F14--97,Figure 9.11 shows a chicken grows into an adult.
exqm_484F14--98,Do all organisms respire?
exqm_484F14--99,Can we live without breathing?
exqm_484F14--100," When we inhale, the air moves from outside"
exqm_484F14--101,to the inside of our body. When we breathe out.
exqm_484F14--102,The air moves from inside our body to outside.
exqm_484F14--103,Breathing is part of a process called
exqm_484F14--104,respiration. In respiration
exqm_484F14--105,Some of the oxygen of the air we breathe in is used by the body.
exqm_484F14--106,we breathe out carbon dioxide 
exqm_484F14--107,Produced in this process.
exqm_484F14--108,The process of breathing in animals like cows.
exqm_484F14--109," Buffaloes, dogs or cats."
exqm_484F14--110,is similar to humans.
exqm_484F14--111,Observe any one of these animals while they are taking rest.
exqm_484F14--112,and notice the movement of their abdomen.
exqm_484F14--113,This slow movement indicates that they are breathing. Page 89
exqm_484F14--114,Respiration is necessary for all living organisms.
exqm_484F14--115,It is through respiration that the body finally obtains energy from the food it takes.
exqm_484F14--116,Some animals may have different mechanisms for the exchange of gases.
exqm_484F14--117," which is a part of the respiration process. For example,"
exqm_484F14--118,earth worms breathe through their skin.
exqm_484F14--119,Fish we have learnt have gills for using oxygen.
exqm_484F14--120,Dissolved in water
exqm_484F14--121,the gills absorb oxygen from the air dissolved in water.
exqm_484F14--122,Do plants also respire.
exqm_484F14--123,Exchange of gases in plants mainly takes place through leaves.
exqm_484F14--124,The leaves take in air through tiny pores in them and use the oxygen.
exqm_484F14--125,They give out carbon dioxide to the air.
exqm_484F14--126,We learnt that in sunlight plants use carbon dioxide.
exqm_484F14--127,to produce food and give out oxygen.
exqm_484F14--128,The amount of oxygen released in the process of food preparation by plants
exqm_484F14--129,is much more than the oxygen they use in respiration.
exqm_484F14--130,Respiration in plants takes place day and night.
exqm_484F14--131,Do all organisms respond to stimuli?
exqm_484F14--132,How do you respond if you suddenly step on a sharp object like a thorn while walking barefoot?
exqm_484F14--133,How do you feel when you see or think about your favorite food?
exqm_484F14--134,You'll suddenly move from a dark place into bright sunlight.
exqm_484F14--135,What happens?
exqm_484F14--136,Your eyes shut themselves automatically for a moment.
exqm_484F14--137,Till they adjust to the changed bright surroundings. Your favorite food?
exqm_484F14--138,bright light and a thorn.
exqm_484F14--139,In the above situations are some examples of changes in your surroundings.
exqm_484F14--140,All of us respond immediately to such changes.
exqm_484F14--141," changes in our surroundings, that makes us respond."
exqm_484F14--142,to them are called stimuli.
exqm_484F14--143,Do other animals also respond to stimuli?
exqm_484F14--144,observe the behavior of animals when food is served to them.
exqm_484F14--145,Do you find them suddenly becoming active on seeing the food? When you move towards a bird...
exqm_484F14--146,What does it do?
exqm_484F14--147,Wild animals run away when bright light is flashed.
exqm_484F14--148," towards them. Similarly,"
exqm_484F14--149,Cockroaches begin to move to their hiding places.
exqm_484F14--150,If the light in the kitchen is switched on at night.
exqm_484F14--151,Can you give some more examples of responses of animals to stimuli? Do plants also respond?
exqm_484F14--152,to stimuli.
exqm_484F14--153,Flowers of some plants bloom only at night.
exqm_484F14--154," In some plants, like mimosa,"
exqm_484F14--155,commonly known as touch me not leaves.
exqm_484F14--156,Close or fold when someone touches them.
exqm_484F14--157,These are some examples of responses of plants.
exqm_484F14--158,towards changes in their surroundings.
exqm_484F14--159,Activity 4. Place a potted plant in a room.
exqm_484F14--160,A little away from a window through which sunlight enters sometime during the day. Figure 9.12.
exqm_484F14--161,Continue watering the plant for a few days. Does the plant grow upright?
exqm_484F14--162,like plants out in the open.
exqm_484F14--163,Note the direction in which it bends.
exqm_484F14--164,if it is not growing upright.
exqm_484F14--165,Do you think this may be in...
exqm_484F14--166,response to some stimulus.
exqm_484F14--167,All living things respond to changes around them. Page 90
exqm_484F14--168,Figure 9.12 shows.
exqm_484F14--169," Plant, Respond to Light"
exqm_484F14--170,Living organisms and excretion
exqm_484F14--171,All organisms need food.
exqm_484F14--172,Not all the food that is eaten is completely used.
exqm_484F14--173,Only a part of it is utilized by the body.
exqm_484F14--174,What happens to the rest?
exqm_484F14--175,This has to be removed from the body as wastes.
exqm_484F14--176,Our body produces some wastes in other life processes also.
exqm_484F14--177,The process of getting rid of wastes by organisms is known as excretion.
exqm_484F14--178,Do plants also excreak? They do!
exqm_484F14--179,but not as seen in animals.
exqm_484F14--180,The mechanisms in plants are a little different.
exqm_484F14--181,some plants find it possible to store the waste products within their parts in a way.
exqm_484F14--182,that they do not harm the plant as a whole.
exqm_484F14--183,Some plants remove.
exqm_484F14--184,waste products as secretions.
exqm_484F14--185,excretion is another characteristic common to all organisms.
exqm_484F14--186,Do all organisms reproduce their own kind?
exqm_484F14--187,Have you ever seen nests of some birds like pigeons?
exqm_484F14--188,Many birds lay their eggs in the nest.
exqm_484F14--189,Some of the eggs hatch and young birds come out of them.
exqm_484F14--190,Figure 9.13
exqm_484F14--191,Animals reproduce their own kind.
exqm_484F14--192,The mode of reproduction may be different in different animals.
exqm_484F14--193,Some animals produce their young ones through eggs.
exqm_484F14--194,Some animals give birth to the young ones.
exqm_484F14--195,Figure 9.14
exqm_484F14--196,Plants also reproduce like animals.
exqm_484F14--197,Plants also differ in their mode of reproduction.
exqm_484F14--198,Many plants reproduce through seeds.
exqm_484F14--199,Figure 9.13A

exqm_484F14--202,Some animals which gave birth to their young ones. Page 91
exqm_484F14--203,Plants produce seeds which can germinate and grow into new plants.
exqm_484F14--204,Figure 9.15
exqm_484F14--205,Some plants also reproduce through parts other than seeds.
exqm_484F14--206," For example, a part of a potato with a bud."
exqm_484F14--207,Grows into a new plant.
exqm_484F14--208,Figure 9.16
exqm_484F14--209,Plants also reproduce through cuttings.
exqm_484F14--210,Would you like to grow a plant in this way yourself?
exqm_484F14--211,Figure 9.15 shows.
exqm_484F14--212,A seed from a plant germinates into a new plant. Figure 9.16
exqm_484F14--213,shows a new plant grows from a bud of potato. Activity 5
exqm_484F14--214,Take a cutting from a rose or a Menhdi plant.
exqm_484F14--215,Fix it in the soil and water it regularly.
exqm_484F14--216,What do you observe after a few days?
exqm_484F14--217,It may not be easy to grow plants from cuttings.
exqm_484F14--218,Do not be disappointed if your cutting does not grow.
exqm_484F14--219,Talk to a gardener if possible.
exqm_484F14--220,On the care to be given to cuttings to make them grow into plants.
exqm_484F14--221,Living Things Produce More Of Their Own Kind
exqm_484F14--222,Through reproduction
exqm_484F14--223,It takes place in many different ways for different organisms.
exqm_484F14--224,Do all organisms move. In chapter 8.
exqm_484F14--225,We discussed the various ways in which animals move. they move
exqm_484F14--226,From one place to another and also show other body movements. What about plants?
exqm_484F14--227,Do they also move?
exqm_484F14--228,Plants are generally anchored in soil.
exqm_484F14--229,So they do not move from one place to another. however
exqm_484F14--230," Various substances like water, minerals and the food synthesized by them."
exqm_484F14--231,Move from one part of the plant to other.
exqm_484F14--232,Have you noticed any other kind of movement in plants?
exqm_484F14--233,Opening or Closing of Flowers
exqm_484F14--234,Do you recall how some plants show movement in response to certain stimuli?
exqm_484F14--235,We also have some non-living things moving.
exqm_484F14--236," Of course, A bus, car,"
exqm_484F14--237," a small piece of paper, clouds and so on."
exqm_484F14--238,Is there something different in these movements?
exqm_484F14--239,From the movements of living beings
exqm_484F14--240," There is such a variety of living organisms, but..."
exqm_484F14--241,All of them show some common characteristics.
exqm_484F14--242,as we have discussed.
exqm_484F14--243,Yet another common characteristic is that...
exqm_484F14--244,Living beings die.
exqm_484F14--245,Because organisms die?
exqm_484F14--246,particular types of organisms can survive over thousands of years.
exqm_484F14--247,only if they reproduce their own kind.
exqm_484F14--248,one single organism may die without ever reproducing but...
exqm_484F14--249,The type of organism can exist.
exqm_484F14--250,only if there is reproduction.
exqm_484F14--251,page 92. We see that all living things.
exqm_484F14--252," seem to have some common characteristics. They all need food, respire."
exqm_484F14--253,respond to stimuli.
exqm_484F14--254,Reproduce Show movement
exqm_484F14--255,Grow and die.
exqm_484F14--256,Do we find some non-living things that also show some of these characteristics?
exqm_484F14--257," cars, bicycle, clocks and the water in the river move."
exqm_484F14--258,The moon moves in the sky. A cloud.
exqm_484F14--259,Grows in size right in front of our eyes.
exqm_484F14--260,Can such things be called living?
exqm_484F14--261,We ask ourselves. Do these objects also show?
exqm_484F14--262,All the other characteristics of living things In general
exqm_484F14--263,Something that is living may have all the characteristics that we have discussed.
exqm_484F14--264,While non-living things may not show all these characteristics at the same time.
exqm_484F14--265,Is this always true?
exqm_484F14--266,Do we always find that living things definitely show all the characteristics of the living?
exqm_484F14--267,that we have discussed.
exqm_484F14--268,Do we always find that non-living things may show only some of these characteristics and never all of them? To understand this a little better.
exqm_484F14--269,Let us look at a specific example.
exqm_484F14--270,"Consider any seed, say,moong."
exqm_484F14--271,Is it living?
exqm_484F14--272,It can stay in a shop for months and not show any growth or some of the other characteristics of life.
exqm_484F14--273," However, we bring the same seed and plant it in soil."
exqm_484F14--274,water it and it turns into a whole plant. Did the seed?
exqm_484F14--275,Need food? Did it excrete?
exqm_484F14--276,Grow or reproduce when it was in the shop for many months?
exqm_484F14--277,We see that
exqm_484F14--278,There can be cases when we cannot easily say that a thing has all the characteristics.
exqm_484F14--279,that we have discussed for it to be called
exqm_484F14--280,Living
exqm_484F14--281,what then is life
exqm_484F14--282,Push your hand deep inside the sack of wheat.
exqm_484F14--283,Do you find it is warm inside?
exqm_484F14--284,There is some heat being produced inside the sack of wheat. The seeds respire.
exqm_484F14--285,and in that process give out some heat.
exqm_484F14--286,We see that respiration is a process that takes place in seeds.
exqm_484F14--287,Even when some of the other life processes may not be very active.
exqm_484F14--288," It may not be very easy to answer our question, what then is life?"
exqm_484F14--289," However, looking at all the diversity of living beings around us, we can conclude that..."
exqm_484F14--290,Life is beautiful. Key words.

exqm_484F14--299,Summary
exqm_484F14--300,The surroundings where plants and animals live.
exqm_484F14--301,It's called their habitat.
exqm_484F14--302,Several kinds of plants and animals may share the same habitat.
exqm_484F14--303,The presence of specific features and habits.
exqm_484F14--304,which enable a plant or an animal to live in a particular habitat.
exqm_484F14--305,is called Adaptation.
exqm_484F14--306,There are many types of habitats.

5uxqKvxw-FQ--2,This is the lesson 14. Title
5uxqKvxw-FQ--3,water from page
5uxqKvxw-FQ--4,136 to
5uxqKvxw-FQ--5,146
5uxqKvxw-FQ--6,Page 136
5uxqKvxw-FQ--7,Let's listen to the lesson 14.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--8,Water
5uxqKvxw-FQ--9,Suppose for some reason
5uxqKvxw-FQ--10,Your family gets only one bucket of water every day for a week.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--11," Imagine what would happen. Would you be able to cook clean utensils, wash clothes"
5uxqKvxw-FQ--12,or bathe
5uxqKvxw-FQ--13,What are the other activities you would not be able to do?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--14,What would happen if we do not have easy access to water for a long period of time?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--15," Apart from drinking, there are so many activities."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--16,for which we use water.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--17,Figure 14.1
5uxqKvxw-FQ--18,Do you have an idea about the quantity of water we use in a single day?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--19,Figure 14.1 shows uses of water.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--20,14.1
5uxqKvxw-FQ--21,How much water do we use?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--22,Activity 1
5uxqKvxw-FQ--23,List all the activities for which you use water in a day.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--24,Some activities are listed in table 14.1.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--25,Make a similar table in your notebook.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--26,throughout the day.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--27,Measure the amount of water used for
5uxqKvxw-FQ--28,each activity by you and other family members.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--29,you may use a mug
5uxqKvxw-FQ--30," a glass, a bucket or any other container"
5uxqKvxw-FQ--31,to measure the amount of water used.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--32," Here is the table given, table 14.1."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--33,estimation of the amount of water used by a family in a day.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--34,This table is divided into two columns. One is for activity.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--35,and the second one is for amount of water used.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--36,The activities are drinking.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--37,brushing bathing
5uxqKvxw-FQ--38,washing utensils
5uxqKvxw-FQ--39,washing clothes
5uxqKvxw-FQ--40,toilets
5uxqKvxw-FQ--41,cleaning floor
5uxqKvxw-FQ--42,Any other? Total water used in a day by a
5uxqKvxw-FQ--43,family.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--44,Complete this table according to your observation.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--46,You now have a rough idea.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--47,as to how much water your family uses in a day
5uxqKvxw-FQ--48,Using this information
5uxqKvxw-FQ--49,Calculate the amount of water needed by your family in a year.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--50," Now, divide this amount by the number of members of your family."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--51,This will give an idea of the amount of water needed by one member of your family in a year.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--52,Find the number of people that live in your village or town.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--53,Page 137
5uxqKvxw-FQ--54,You may now get an idea of the amount of water needed by your village or town in a year.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--55,Boojho Wonders
5uxqKvxw-FQ--56,whether people living in different regions of our country get the same amount of water.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--57,are their regions where people do not get adequate amount of water?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--58,How do they manage? You have listed a number of activities for which you use water.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--59,Do you think our water requirement is limited to activities like these? We use wheat
5uxqKvxw-FQ--60," Rise, pulses, vegetables"
5uxqKvxw-FQ--61,and many other food items everyday.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--62,We know that some of the fibers that we use for making fabric
5uxqKvxw-FQ--63,Come from plants.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--64,Is water not needed to grow these?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--65,Can you think of some more uses of water?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--66,Water is used in industries for producing almost all the things that we use.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--67," So, we need water not only for..."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--68,our daily activities.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--69,but also for producing many things.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--70,Paheli wants to tell you
5uxqKvxw-FQ--71,that about 2 glasses of water are required to produce each page of a book.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--72,14.2
5uxqKvxw-FQ--73,Where do we get water from?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--74,Where do you get the water that you use?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--75," Some of you may say, we draw water from a river."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--76,spring pond
5uxqKvxw-FQ--77,well
5uxqKvxw-FQ--78,or a hand pump.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--79,Some others might see.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--80,We get water from taps.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--81,Have you ever wondered where water in the taps comes from?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--82,Water that we get from taps is also drawn from a lake or a river or a well.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--83,figure 14.2.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--84,It is then supplied through a network of pipes.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--85,Figure 14.2 Shows
5uxqKvxw-FQ--86," Water in taps comes from rivers, lakes or wells."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--87,Each of us may be getting water into our homes in different ways.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--88," But finally, all of us get water from the same sources such as ponds, lakes, rivers."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--89,and wells.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--90,We have discussed some of the sources of water.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--91," Where does the water come from? To fill these ponds, lakes, rivers and wells?"
5uxqKvxw-FQ--92,Boojho wants you to imagine a day in your life.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--93,When water supply through taps is not available.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--94,So you have to fetch it yourself from a far away place. Would you use the same amount of water as on any other day?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--95,Page 138
5uxqKvxw-FQ--96,Figure 14.3 Shows
5uxqKvxw-FQ--97,Oceans cover a major part of the earth.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--98,Do you know that?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--99,About 2-3rds of the earth is covered with water.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--100,Most of this water is in oceans and seas.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--101,Figure 14.3
5uxqKvxw-FQ--102,The water in the oceans and seas.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--103,has many salts dissolved in it.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--104,The water is saline.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--105," So, it is not fit for drinking and other domestic agricultural and industrial needs."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--106," You might have heard the famous lines of the poem, Rime of the Ancient Mariner."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--107,written by ST Coleridge in 
5uxqKvxw-FQ--108,1798
5uxqKvxw-FQ--109," Water, water everywhere"
5uxqKvxw-FQ--110,nor any drop to drink.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--111,Here the poet has described.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--112,The plight of sailors on a ship lost in the ocean.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--113," Yet, oceans play an important role in supplying the water that we use."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--114,Do you find this surprising?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--115," After all, the water that we use is not salty."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--116,Many of us live in places far away from the oceans.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--117,Does the water supply in these places also depend on the oceans?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--118," How does the ocean water reach ponds, lakes, rivers and wells?"
5uxqKvxw-FQ--119,Which Supply us Water
5uxqKvxw-FQ--120,How come the water from these sources is not saline anymore?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--121,That is where the water cycle comes in. 14.3
5uxqKvxw-FQ--122,Water Cycle
5uxqKvxw-FQ--123,Disappearing trick of water
5uxqKvxw-FQ--124,How many times have you noticed that water spilled on a floor dries up after some time? The water seems to disappear.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--125,similarly
5uxqKvxw-FQ--126,Water disappears from wet clothes as they dry up.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--127,Figure 14.4
5uxqKvxw-FQ--128," Water from wet roads, rooftops and a few other places also disappears after the rains."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--129,Where does this water go? Do you remember activity 6 in chapter 5 in which water with salt dissolved in it was heated?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--130,What did we find?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--131,The water evaporated and the salt was left behind.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--132,This activity gives us an idea.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--133,that on heating water changes into its vapor.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--134,We also realize from this activity
5uxqKvxw-FQ--135,that water vapor does not carry away the salt with it.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--136,Water vapors so formed become a part of the air and cannot usually be seen.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--138,We also found that heating is essential to convert water 
5uxqKvxw-FQ--139,into its vapor.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--140," However, we have seen that water changes into its vapour also from the fields, roads."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--141,rooftops and other land areas.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--142," Figure 14.4 shows, cloths drying on a cloths line."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--143,Page 139
5uxqKvxw-FQ--144,We also discussed in Chapter 5 that to obtain salt.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--145,Water from the sea is left in shallow pits to let the water evaporate.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--146,From where does this water get the heat it needs to evaporate?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--147,Let us find out.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--148,Activity 2
5uxqKvxw-FQ--149,Take two similar plates.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--150,Place one of the plates in sunlight.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--151,and keep the other under shade.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--152,Now pour equal amount of water in each of the plates.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--153,Figure 14.5 You can use a cap of a bottle.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--154,to measure water.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--155,Make sure that water does not spill over.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--156,Observe the two plates after every 15 minutes.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--157,Does the water seem to disappear?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--158,From which plate does it disappear first?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--159,What is the source of heat for this evaporation?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--160,During the daytime
5uxqKvxw-FQ--161," Sunlight falls on the water in oceans, rivers"
5uxqKvxw-FQ--162,Lakes and Ponds
5uxqKvxw-FQ--163,The fields and other land areas also receive sunlight.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--164," As a result, water from all these places continuously changes into vapor."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--165," However, the salt dissolved in the water are left behind."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--167,in Activity 2. Did you find that water
5uxqKvxw-FQ--168,also disappeared from the plate.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--169," kept in the shade, though it could have taken more time."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--170," Does the heat from the sunlight reach here? Yes, during the day..."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--171,time all the air surrounding us gets heated.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--172,This warm air provides heat for evaporation of water in the shade.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--174," Thus, evaporation takes place from all open surfaces of water."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--175,as a result.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--176,Water vapor gets continuously added to air.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--177," However, evaporation of water is a slow process."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--178,That is why we rarely notice its loss from a bucket full of water.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--179," In sunlight, evaporation takes place faster."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--180," On heating water on a burner, its evaporation takes place even faster."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--181,Is there any other process through which water vapor gets transferred into air?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--182,Figure 14.5 Shows
5uxqKvxw-FQ--183,Boojho has been reading about transpiration. He asked himself how much water is lost through transpiration by wheat plants that give us 1 kilogram of wheat.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--184,He found out that this is nearly 500
5uxqKvxw-FQ--185,litres
5uxqKvxw-FQ--186,That is roughly 25 large sized buckets full of
5uxqKvxw-FQ--187,water. Can you now imagine the amount of water lost by plants of all the forests?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--188,Crops and grasslands together.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--189,Loss of water by plants
5uxqKvxw-FQ--190,You have learnt in Chapter 7 that plants need water.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--191,to grow.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--192,Plants use a part of this water to prepare their food and retain some of it in their different parts.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--193,Page 140
5uxqKvxw-FQ--194,Remaining part of this water is released by the plants into air as water vapour through the process of transpiration.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--195,Do you remember observing transpiration of water by plants in Activity 4 in Chapter 7?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--197,Water vapor enters the air through the processes of evaporation and transpiration.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--198," Is it lost forever? No, we get it back again as we will see."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--199,How are clouds formed?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--200,Activity 3
5uxqKvxw-FQ--201,take a glass half filled with water
5uxqKvxw-FQ--202,Wipe the glass from the outside with a clean piece of cloth.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--203,Add some ice into the water.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--204,Wait for 1 or 2 minutes. Observe the changes that take place on the outer surface of the glass.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--205,Figure 14.6
5uxqKvxw-FQ--206,From where do water drops appear on the outer side of the glass?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--207,The cold surface of the glass containing iced water cools the air around it.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--208,and the water vapor of the air condenses on the surface
5uxqKvxw-FQ--209,of the glass.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--210,We noticed this process of condensation in Activity 7 in Chapter 5.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--211,Figure 14.6 Shows
5uxqKvxw-FQ--212,Drops of water appear on outer surface of the glass containing water with ice. Paheli has noticed dew on leaves of grass on winter mornings.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--213,Did you notice something similar on leaves or metal surfaces like?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--214,Iron grills and gates on a cold morning.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--215,Is this also due to condensation?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--216,Do you see this happening on hot summer mornings?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--217,The process of condensation plays an important role in bringing water back to the surface of Earth.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--218,How does it happen?
5uxqKvxw-FQ--219," As we go higher from the surface of the earth, it gets cooler."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--220," When the air moves up, it gets cooler and cooler. As sufficient heights, the air becomes so cool that the water vapor present in it."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--221,Condenses to form tiny drops of water called droplets.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--222,It is these tiny droplets that remain floating in air and appear to us as clouds.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--223,Figure 14.7
5uxqKvxw-FQ--224,It is so happens that many droplets of water come together to form large sized drops of water.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--225,Figure 14.7 Shows Clouds
5uxqKvxw-FQ--226,Page 141
5uxqKvxw-FQ--227,Some drops of water become so heavy.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--228,that they begin to fall.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--229,These falling water drops are what we call rain.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--230," in special conditions, it may also fall as hail or snow."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--231," Thus, water in the form of vapour goes into air by evaporation and transpiration. Forms clouds and then comes back to the ground as rain."
5uxqKvxw-FQ--232,Hale or snow.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--233,Boojho has noticed fog.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--234,near the ground in winter mornings.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--235,He wonders if this is also condensation of water vapour near the ground.
5uxqKvxw-FQ--236,What do you think?

s8BUs77tQZ4--19,Arvind was supposed to be acting as Samudragupta  A famous ruler.
s8BUs77tQZ4--20,of a dynasty known as the Guptas.
s8BUs77tQZ4--21,We know about Samudrgupta from a long inscription inscribed on the Ashokan pillar at Allahabad.
s8BUs77tQZ4--22,It was composed as a kavya by Harishena.
s8BUs77tQZ4--23,who was a poet and a minister at the court of Samudragupta.
s8BUs77tQZ4--24,This inscription is of a special kind known as
s8BUs77tQZ4--25,prashasti
s8BUs77tQZ4--26,a Sanskrit word meaning.
s8BUs77tQZ4--27,In praise of
s8BUs77tQZ4--28,while Prashastis were composed for some of the rulers.

s8BUs77tQZ4--32,of the Guptas.
s8BUs77tQZ4--33,samudragupta's prashasti
s8BUs77tQZ4--34,Let us see what Samudragupta Prashasti tells us.
s8BUs77tQZ4--35," The poet praised the king in glowing terms as a warrior, as a king."
s8BUs77tQZ4--36,who won victories in battle.
s8BUs77tQZ4--37,who was learned and best of poets.
s8BUs77tQZ4--38,he is also described as equal to the gods.
s8BUs77tQZ4--39,The prashasti was composed in very long sentences.
s8BUs77tQZ4--40,Here is part of one such sentence.
s8BUs77tQZ4--41,Page number 104
s8BUs77tQZ4--42,samudragupta

s8BUs77tQZ4--49,What does this description tell you about the King?
s8BUs77tQZ4--50,If you look at Map 7 page number 105 you will notice an area shaded in green.
s8BUs77tQZ4--51,You will also find a series of red dots along the east coast and you will find areas marked in purple and blue as well.
s8BUs77tQZ4--53,This map is based on the information provided in the Prashasti.
s8BUs77tQZ4--54,Harishena
s8BUs77tQZ4--55,describes four different kinds of rulers and tells us.
s8BUs77tQZ4--56,about samudragupta's policies towards them.
s8BUs77tQZ4--57,Number 1. The Rulers of Aryavarta.
s8BUs77tQZ4--58,the area shaded in green on the map. Here there were 9 rulers.
s8BUs77tQZ4--59,who were uprooted and their kingdoms were made a part of Samudragupta's empire.

s8BUs77tQZ4--72," They brought tribute, followed his orders and attended his court."
s8BUs77tQZ4--73,Number four The
s8BUs77tQZ4--74,rulers of the outlying areas marked in blue on the map. Perhaps...
s8BUs77tQZ4--75,the descendants of the Kushanas and Shakas.
s8BUs77tQZ4--76,and the ruler of Sri Lanka
s8BUs77tQZ4--77,who submitted to him and offered daughters in marriage.

s8BUs77tQZ4--157,107. Harsh.
s8BUs77tQZ4--158,was not the eldest son of his father.

s8BUs77tQZ4--160,"After both his father and elder brother died,"
s8BUs77tQZ4--161,His brother-in-law was the ruler of Kannauj.
s8BUs77tQZ4--162,see map number 7.
s8BUs77tQZ4--163,and he was killed by the ruler of Bengal.
s8BUs77tQZ4--165,Harsh took over the Kingdom of Kannauj and then led an army against the ruler of Bengal.
s8BUs77tQZ4--166,although he was successful in the East and conquered Magadha.
s8BUs77tQZ4--167,and probably Bengal also.
s8BUs77tQZ4--168,He was not as successful elsewhere.
s8BUs77tQZ4--170,"He tried to cross the Narmada to march into the Deccan,"
s8BUs77tQZ4--171,but was stopped by a ruler.
s8BUs77tQZ4--172,belonging to the Chalukya Dynasty.

s8BUs77tQZ4--181,"Prashasti, the Pallavas  and Chalukyas"
s8BUs77tQZ4--182,were the most important ruling Dynasties in South India during this period.
s8BUs77tQZ4--183,"The Kingdom of the Pallavas spread from the region around their capital,Kanchipuram."
s8BUs77tQZ4--184,to the kaveri delta.
s8BUs77tQZ4--185,While that of the Chalukyas was centered
s8BUs77tQZ4--186,"around the  Raichur Doab,"
s8BUs77tQZ4--187,between the river Krishna and Tungabhadra.
s8BUs77tQZ4--188,"Aihole, the capital of Chalukyas"
s8BUs77tQZ4--189,was an important trading center.
s8BUs77tQZ4--190,see map 7
s8BUs77tQZ4--191,It developed as a religious center with a number of temples.
s8BUs77tQZ4--192,The Pallavas and Chalukyas frequently raided one another's lands.
s8BUs77tQZ4--193,especially attacking the capital cities.
s8BUs77tQZ4--195,which were prosperous towns.
s8BUs77tQZ4--196,The best known Chalukya Ruler was Pulakeshin II.
s8BUs77tQZ4--197,We know about him from a Prasastri composed by his court poet Ravi Kirti.
s8BUs77tQZ4--198,This tells us about his ancestors.
s8BUs77tQZ4--199,who are traced back through four generations from father to son.
s8BUs77tQZ4--200,Pulakeshin evidently got the kingdom from his...

s8BUs77tQZ4--202,page number 108.
s8BUs77tQZ4--203,according to Ravi Kirti.
s8BUs77tQZ4--204,He led expeditions along both the West and the East Coasts.
s8BUs77tQZ4--205," Besides, he checked the advance of Harsh."
s8BUs77tQZ4--206,There is an interesting play of words in the poem.
s8BUs77tQZ4--207,Harsh means happiness. The poet says.
s8BUs77tQZ4--208," that after this defeat, Harsh was no longer Harsh."
s8BUs77tQZ4--210,Pulakeshin also attacked the Pallava King.

aTB_lu2Im8Y--3," Light, shadows and reflections."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--4," We see so many objects around us. On the way to school, we see things like buses, cars,"
aTB_lu2Im8Y--5,"Cycles,"
aTB_lu2Im8Y--6,"Trees,"
aTB_lu2Im8Y--7,Animals and sometimes flowers.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--8,How do you think we see objects?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--9,Think of the same places at night time if it were completely dark.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--10,What will you see?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--11,Suppose you go inside a completely dark room. Are you able to see any objects in the room?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--12," But when you light a candle or a torch, you can see the objects present in the room, isn't it?"
aTB_lu2Im8Y--13," Without light, things cannot be seen. Light helps us see objects."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--14,The torch bulb is an object that gives out light of its own.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--15,The sun is another familiar object that gives its own light.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--16," During the day, its light allows us to see objects."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--17,objects like the sun that give out or emit light of their own are called luminous objects.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--18," What about objects like a chair, a painting or a shoe?"
aTB_lu2Im8Y--19," We see these when light from a luminous object like the sun, a torch or an electric light."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--20,Falls on these and then travels towards our eye.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--21,11.1
aTB_lu2Im8Y--22," Transparent, opaque and translucent objects."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--23," Recall our grouping objects as opaque, transparent or translucent in chapter 4."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--24," If we cannot see through an object at all, it is an opaque object."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--25," If you are able to see clearly through an object, it is allowing light to pass through it and is transparent."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--26," There are some objects through which we can see, but not very clearly."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--27,Such objects are known as translucent.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--28,Activity 1
aTB_lu2Im8Y--29,"Look around yourself and collect as many objects as you can. An eraser.,plastic scale."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--30,"pen,pencil,"
aTB_lu2Im8Y--31,"notebook,"
aTB_lu2Im8Y--32,"Single sheet of paper,"
aTB_lu2Im8Y--33,tracing paper or a piece of cloth.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--34,Try to look at something far away through each of these objects.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--35,Figure 11.1.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--36,Is light from a far away object able to travel to your eye through any of the objects?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--37,Record your observations in a table as shown in table 11.1.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--38," We see that a given object or material could be transparent, translucent or opaque."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--39," Depending on whether it allows light to pass through it completely, partially or not at all."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--40,Figure 11.1 shows.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--41,You are given a table which is divided into three columns.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--42,One is for object or material
aTB_lu2Im8Y--43,Second is for view through the object possible fully partially or not at all.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--44,"and the third one is for Object is opaque, transparent and translucent."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--45," Objects are pencil, rubber ball, sheet of writing paper."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--46,Complete this table according to your observation.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--47,11.2
aTB_lu2Im8Y--48,What exactly are shadows?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--49,Activity 2
aTB_lu2Im8Y--50," Now, one by one hold each of the opaque objects in the sunlight slightly above the ground."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--51,What do you see on the ground?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--52,You know that the dark patch formed by each on the ground is due to its shadow.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--53,Sometimes you can identify the object by looking at its shadow.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--54,Figure 11.2
aTB_lu2Im8Y--55," Spread a sheet of paper on the ground, hold a familiar opaque object at some height, so that its shadow is formed on the sheet of paper on the ground."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--56,Ask one of your friends to draw the outline of the shadow while you are holding the object.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--57,Draw outlines of the shadows of other objects in a similar way. Now ask some other fri..
aTB_lu2Im8Y--58,ends to identify the objects from these outlines of shadows. How many objects are they able to identify correctly?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--59,Do you observe your shadow in a dark room or at night when there is no light?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--60,Do you observe a shadow when there is just a source of light and nothing else in a room?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--62,It seems we need a source of light and an opaque object to see a shadow.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--63,Is there anything else required?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--64,Activity 3
aTB_lu2Im8Y--65," This is an activity that you will have to do in the dark. In the evening, go out in an open ground with a few friends, take a torch and a large sheet of .."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--66,Cardboard with you.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--67,Hold the torch close to the ground and shine it upwards so that its light falls
aTB_lu2Im8Y--68,on your friend's face.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--69," You now have a source of light that is falling on an opaque object. If there were no trees, building or any other object behind your friend, would you see the shadow of your friend's head?"
aTB_lu2Im8Y--70,nan 
aTB_lu2Im8Y--71," This does not mean that there is no shadow. After all, the light from the torch is not able to pass through his body to the other side."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--72,"Now ask another friend to hold the cardboard sheet behind your friend, is the shadow now seen on the cardboard sheet."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--73,"Thus ,the shadow can be seen only on a screen."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--74," The ground, walls of a room, a building or other such surfaces act as a screen for the shadows, you observe in everyday life."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--75,Shadows give us some information about shapes of objects. Sometimes shadows can also mislead us about the shape of the object. In figure 11.4
aTB_lu2Im8Y--76,are a few shadows that we can create with our hands and make believe that they are shadows of different animals. Have fun!
aTB_lu2Im8Y--77,Activity 4
aTB_lu2Im8Y--78,Place a chair in the school ground on a sunny day. What do you observe from the shadow of the chair?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--79,Does the shadow give an accurate picture of the shape of the chair? If the chair is turned around a little...
aTB_lu2Im8Y--80,how does the shape of the shadow change?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--81,Take a thin notebook and look at its shadow. Then take a rectangular box.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--82,and look at its shadow.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--83, Do the two shadows seem
aTB_lu2Im8Y--84,to have a similar shape.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--85," Take flowers or other objects of different colours and look at their shadows. A red rose and a yellow rose, for instance. Do the shadows look different in colour when the colours of the objects are different."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--86," Take a long box and look at this shadow on the ground. When you move the box around, you may see that the size of the shadow changes. When is the shadow of the box the shortest when the long side of the box is pointed towards the sun or when the short side is pointing towards the sun."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--87,Let us use this long box to prepare a simple camera.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--88,Page 110.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--89," 11.3, a pinhole camera."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--90," You might think that we need a lot of stuff to make a camera. Not really, if we just wish to make a simple pinhole camera."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--91,Activity 5
aTB_lu2Im8Y--92,Take two boxes of cardboard such that one can slide into another with no gap in between them.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--93,Cut open one side of each box. On the opposite face of the larger box make a small hole in the middle.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--94,Figure 11.58
aTB_lu2Im8Y--95,In this smaller box cut out from the middle as square with a side of about 5 to 6 cm.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--96,Cover this open square in the box with tracing paper or translucent screen.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--97,Figure 11.5B
aTB_lu2Im8Y--98,Slide the smaller box inside the larger one with the hole. In such a way that the side with the tracing paper is inside.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--99,Figure 11.5C
aTB_lu2Im8Y--100,Your pinhole camera is ready for use.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--101,Hold the pinhole camera look through the open face of the smaller box. You should use a piece of black cloth to cover your head and the pinhole camera.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--102,Now try to look at some distant objects like a tree or a building through the pinhole camera.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--103,Make sure that the objects you wish to look at through your pinhole camera are in bright sunshine.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--104,Move the smaller box forward or backward till you get a picture on the tracing paper pasted at the other end.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--105,Are these pinhole images different from their shadows?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--106,Look through your pinhole camera at the vehicles and people moving on the road in bright sunlight.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--107,Do the pictures seen in the camera show the colors of the objects on the other side?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--108," Are the images erect or upside down? Surprise, surprise!"
aTB_lu2Im8Y--109,Let us now image the sun with our pinhole camera.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--110,We need a slightly different setup for this. We just need a large sheet of cardboard with a small pinhole in the middle.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--111,Hold the sheet up in the sun and let it shadow fall on a clear area.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--112,Do you see a small circular image of the sun in the middle of the shadow of the cardboard sheet?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--113," Look at these pinhole images of the sun, when and eclipse is visible from your location."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--114,Adjust your pinhole and screen to get a clear image before the eclipse is to occur.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--115,Look at the image as the eclipse begins.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--116,You will notice a part of the image of the sun gradually becoming darker as the eclipse starts.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--117,Figure 11.5 ABC
aTB_lu2Im8Y--118,Page 111
aTB_lu2Im8Y--119,Never ever look directly at the sun. That could be extremely harmful for the eyes.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--120," There is an interesting pinhole camera in nature. Sometimes when we pass under a tree covered with large number of leaves, we notice small patches of sunlight under it. Figure 11.6"
aTB_lu2Im8Y--121,6
aTB_lu2Im8Y--122," These circular images are, in fact, pinhole images of the sun. The gaps between the leaves act as the pinholes."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--123," These gaps are all kinds of irregular shapes, but we can see circular images of the sun."
aTB_lu2Im8Y--124,Try to locate images of the sun when an eclipse occurs next. That could be so much fun.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--125,Bhoochu has this thought. We saw upside down images of people on the road with our pinhole camera.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--126,What about the mages of the sun? Did we notice them to be upside down or anything like that?
aTB_lu2Im8Y--127,Paheli has another thought. Surely all these results that we are seeing formation of shadows and pin hole images are possible only if light moves in a straight path.
aTB_lu2Im8Y--128,Figure 11.6 shows a natural pinhole camera.

XXeKZUNLAk4--110,Make designs in your copy by tiling those shapes.
XXeKZUNLAk4--111,Now you create your own new tiles out of a square.
XXeKZUNLAk4--112,Can you do the same with a triangle?

XXeKZUNLAk4--119,Circles etc were used to examine which of those can tile and which do not tile to make floor patterns.
XXeKZUNLAk4--120,Children must now be able to modify basic shapes.
XXeKZUNLAk4--121,to create different tiling shapes.
XXeKZUNLAk4--122," In the exercise above, they may create new shapes out of a square."
XXeKZUNLAk4--123," that do not tile, even though their area remains the same as that of the square, from which they are made."

MNP9CuOXrHg--4,Page 95.
MNP9CuOXrHg--5,There was a general discussion among the children in Pahili and Bhojho's class about the places they had visited during the summer vacations.
MNP9CuOXrHg--6,Someone had gone to their native village by a train. Then a bus.
MNP9CuOXrHg--7,and finally a bull of cart
MNP9CuOXrHg--8,one student had travelled by an aeroplane.
MNP9CuOXrHg--9,Another spent many days of his holidays going on fishing trips in his uncle's boat.
MNP9CuOXrHg--10,The teacher then asked them to read newspaper articles that mentioned about some wheeled vehicles that moved on the soil of Mars and conducted experiments.
MNP9CuOXrHg--11,These vehicles were taken by spacecraft all the way to Mars.
MNP9CuOXrHg--12," Meanwhile, Pahili had been reading stories about ancient India and wanted to know how people travelled from one place to another in earlier times."

MNP9CuOXrHg--14,Story of Transport
MNP9CuOXrHg--15,Long ago
MNP9CuOXrHg--16,people did not have any means of transport.
MNP9CuOXrHg--17,They use to move only on foot and carry goods on their back.
MNP9CuOXrHg--18," Later on, they begin to use animals for transportation."
MNP9CuOXrHg--19,"for transport through water , roots boat were used  from ancient time"
MNP9CuOXrHg--20," To begin with, boards were simple logs of wood in which a hollow cavity could be made."
MNP9CuOXrHg--21," Later, pupil learnt to put together different pieces of wood and gives shapes to the boats."
MNP9CuOXrHg--22,These shapes imitated the shapes of the animals living in water.
MNP9CuOXrHg--23,Recall our discussions of this streamlined shape of fish in chapters 8 and 9.
MNP9CuOXrHg--24,Invention of the wheel made a great change in modes of transport.
MNP9CuOXrHg--25,The design of the wheel was improved over thousands of years.
MNP9CuOXrHg--26,Animals were used to pull cars that moved on wheels.
MNP9CuOXrHg--27,until the beginning of the 19th century.
MNP9CuOXrHg--28," People still depended on animals, boards and ships to transport them from place to place."
MNP9CuOXrHg--29,The invention of steam engine led to the development of new means of transport.
MNP9CuOXrHg--30,Railroads were made for steam engine driven carriages and wagons.
MNP9CuOXrHg--31," Later came automobiles such as motor cars, trucks and buses."
MNP9CuOXrHg--32,Figure 10.1 shows some means of transportation.
MNP9CuOXrHg--34,Page 96.
MNP9CuOXrHg--35,Motorized boats and ships were used as means of transport on water.
MNP9CuOXrHg--36," The early years of 1900,"
MNP9CuOXrHg--37,saw the development of aeroplanes.
MNP9CuOXrHg--38, These were later improved to carry passengers and goods.
MNP9CuOXrHg--39," Electric trains, monorail, supersonic airplanes and space."
MNP9CuOXrHg--40,craft.
MNP9CuOXrHg--41,are some of the contributions of the 20th century.
MNP9CuOXrHg--42,Figure 10.1 shows some of the different modes of transport.

MNP9CuOXrHg--46,How wide is this desk?
MNP9CuOXrHg--47,How did people know how far they have traveled?
MNP9CuOXrHg--48,How will you know whether you can walk all the way to your school or whether you will need to take a bus or a rickshaw to reach your school?
MNP9CuOXrHg--49," When you need to purchase something, is it possible for you?"
MNP9CuOXrHg--50,to walk to the market.
MNP9CuOXrHg--51,How will you know the answers to these questions? It is...
MNP9CuOXrHg--52,Often important to know how far are places.
MNP9CuOXrHg--53,so that we can have an idea how we are going to reach that place.
MNP9CuOXrHg--54," Walk, take a bus or a train, a ship,"
MNP9CuOXrHg--55,an aeroplane or e-vina spacecraft.
MNP9CuOXrHg--56," Sometimes, there are objects whose length or width we need to know."
MNP9CuOXrHg--57," In Pahili and Bhojho's classroom, there are large desks which are to be shared by two students."
MNP9CuOXrHg--58," Paheli and Bhojo share one desk, but frequently end up objecting that the other is using a larger share of the desk. on the teacher's"
MNP9CuOXrHg--59, decision they decided to measure the length of the desk.
MNP9CuOXrHg--60,Make a mark exactly in the middle of it and draw a line to separate the two halves of the desk.
MNP9CuOXrHg--61,Both Paheli and bhojo are very fond of playing Gilly Danda with their friends.
MNP9CuOXrHg--62, Bhojo brought a set of Gilly Danda with him
MNP9CuOXrHg--63,Here is how they tried to measure the length of the desk using the Danda and the gilly.
MNP9CuOXrHg--64,Figure 10.2
MNP9CuOXrHg--65,The desk seems to be having a length equal to 2 Danda lengths and
MNP9CuOXrHg--66,2 lengths of the gilly.
MNP9CuOXrHg--67,Drawing a line in the middle of the desk leaves each of them happy with a half of the desk equal to a danda.
MNP9CuOXrHg--68,and a gilly in length.
MNP9CuOXrHg--69," After a few days, the marked line gets wiped out."
MNP9CuOXrHg--70,Bhojo now has new set of Gilly and danda as he lost his old one.
MNP9CuOXrHg--71,Here is how the length of the desk seems to measure using the gilly and danda.
MNP9CuOXrHg--72,Figure 10.3
MNP9CuOXrHg--73,Figure 10.2 shows measuring the length of a desk with gilly and danda.
MNP9CuOXrHg--74,Figure 10.2 shows measuring the length of a desk with different set of gilly and danda.
MNP9CuOXrHg--75,page 97
MNP9CuOXrHg--76," Hello! Now, when measured with the new set of Gilly and Danda."
MNP9CuOXrHg--77,The desk length seems to be about 2 danda lengths.
MNP9CuOXrHg--78,One gilly length with a small length still left out.
MNP9CuOXrHg--79,This is less than one gilly length.
MNP9CuOXrHg--80,Now what?
MNP9CuOXrHg--81,What would you suggest Paheli and Bhojo do?
MNP9CuOXrHg--82,to measure the length of the whole desk.
MNP9CuOXrHg--83,Can they use a Cricket Wicked and Bails to measure the length?
MNP9CuOXrHg--84,Or do you think that this might create the similar problem?
MNP9CuOXrHg--85,One thing they could do is to take a small length of string and mark.
MNP9CuOXrHg--86,2 points on it. This will be a string length.
MNP9CuOXrHg--87,They can measure the width of the desk in string lengths.
MNP9CuOXrHg--88,Figure 10.4
MNP9CuOXrHg--89,How can they use the string to measure distances less than the length of a string?
MNP9CuOXrHg--90,They can fold the string and mark it into
MNP9CuOXrHg--91,1 by 2
MNP9CuOXrHg--92,1 by 4 and 1 by 8
MNP9CuOXrHg--93,string lengths.
MNP9CuOXrHg--94," Now, perhaps, Paheli and Bhojo can measure the exact length of the desk using the string."
MNP9CuOXrHg--95,You would say that they should use the scale in their geometry box and solve their problem?
MNP9CuOXrHg--96," Yes, of course!"
MNP9CuOXrHg--97,Bujo has been reading about the way people used to measure distances before such standard skills were made.
MNP9CuOXrHg--98,and he has been trying to follow different methods of measuring distances. There are so many occasions when we come across a need to measure lengths and distances.
MNP9CuOXrHg--99,The tailor needs to measure the length of the cloth.
MNP9CuOXrHg--100,to know if it is enough to stay chakurta.
MNP9CuOXrHg--101,A carpenter needs to measure the height and width of a cupboard to know how much wood he would need to make its door.
MNP9CuOXrHg--102,The farmer needs to know the length and breadth or the area of his land to know.
MNP9CuOXrHg--103,How much seed he can sow and how much water would be needed for his crops? How much seed he can sow and how much water would be needed for his crops? Suppose you are us.
MNP9CuOXrHg--104,how tall you are.
MNP9CuOXrHg--105,You want to tell the length of the straight line from the top of your head to the heel of your feet.
MNP9CuOXrHg--106,How long is this room?
MNP9CuOXrHg--107,How wide is this desk?
MNP9CuOXrHg--108,How far is it from Delhi to Lucknow?
MNP9CuOXrHg--109,How far away is the moon from the earth?
MNP9CuOXrHg--110,All these questions have one thing in common.
MNP9CuOXrHg--111,They all concern distance between two places.
MNP9CuOXrHg--112,The two places may be close enough like the two ends of a table.
MNP9CuOXrHg--113,Or they may be far apart like Jamu & Kanya Kumari.
MNP9CuOXrHg--114,Let us do a few measurements to see what exactly we need to do.
MNP9CuOXrHg--115,when we measure distances or length
MNP9CuOXrHg--116,10.3
MNP9CuOXrHg--117,some measurements.
MNP9CuOXrHg--118,Activity 1
MNP9CuOXrHg--119,page 98.
MNP9CuOXrHg--120,Work in groups and each of you do this activity one by one.
MNP9CuOXrHg--121,Using your foot as a unit of length
MNP9CuOXrHg--122,Measure the length and breadth of the classroom.
MNP9CuOXrHg--123," It is possible that while measuring these, you may find some part remains to be measured as it is smaller than your foot."
MNP9CuOXrHg--124,Use a string to measure the length of a part of your foot as you did before.
MNP9CuOXrHg--125,Record your observations in table 10.1.
MNP9CuOXrHg--126,Here is table given table 10.1.
MNP9CuOXrHg--127,music
MNP9CuOXrHg--128,measuring the length and breadth of classroom
MNP9CuOXrHg--129,It is divided into three columns. One is for name of the student.
MNP9CuOXrHg--130,Second is for length of the classroom.
MNP9CuOXrHg--131,And the third one is for width of the classroom.
MNP9CuOXrHg--132,Now complete this table according to your observations.
MNP9CuOXrHg--133,Activity 2
MNP9CuOXrHg--134,Work in a group and each of you use your handspan as a unit.
MNP9CuOXrHg--135,to measure the width of a table or a desk in the classroom.
MNP9CuOXrHg--136,Figure 10.5
MNP9CuOXrHg--137," Here too, you may find that you need string lengths equal to your handspan and then fractions of this string length to make the measurement."
MNP9CuOXrHg--138,Record all observations in table 10.2.
MNP9CuOXrHg--139,Figure 10.5 shows measuring the width of a table with a hand span.
MNP9CuOXrHg--140,We see that measurement means the comparison of an unknown quantity with some known quantity.
MNP9CuOXrHg--141,This known fixed quantity is called a unit.
MNP9CuOXrHg--142,The result of a measurement is expressed in two parts.
MNP9CuOXrHg--143,One part is a number.
MNP9CuOXrHg--144,The other part is the unit of the measurement.
MNP9CuOXrHg--145," For example, if in Activity 1, the length of the room is found to be 12 lengths."
MNP9CuOXrHg--146,of your foot.
MNP9CuOXrHg--147,Then 12 is the number and foot length is the unit selected for the measurement.
MNP9CuOXrHg--148,Now study all the measurements recorded in table 10.1 and 10.2.
MNP9CuOXrHg--149,all the measurements for the room using everybody's foot.
MNP9CuOXrHg--150,equal
MNP9CuOXrHg--151,Are everybody's measurement by handspan of the width of the table equal?
MNP9CuOXrHg--152,Perhaps the results could be different as the length of your handspan and that of your friends may not be the same.
MNP9CuOXrHg--153," Similarly, the length of the foot may be slightly different for all the students. Therefore, when you tell your measurement using your handspan or length of foot as a unit to others, they will not be able to understand how big the actual length is, unless they know the length of your handspan or foot."
MNP9CuOXrHg--154,"we see therefore,"
MNP9CuOXrHg--155,That some standard units of measurement are needed.
MNP9CuOXrHg--156,That do not change from person to person.

CO-cLZl36nI--5," Math Magic Class 4, page 14."
CO-cLZl36nI--6,Do you know how he became a minister?
CO-cLZl36nI--7,Birbal was then a young boy living in a village.
CO-cLZl36nI--8,He was very clever and could write poetry.
CO-cLZl36nI--9,He thought he would try his luck in the King's court.
CO-cLZl36nI--10,so he took some of his poems and set off for the city.
CO-cLZl36nI--12," When he reached the outer gate of the palace, he was stopped by the gatekeeper."
CO-cLZl36nI--13," Hey, stop there. Where are you going?"
CO-cLZl36nI--14,Shouted the gatekeeper.
CO-cLZl36nI--15,I am a poet. I want to see King Akbar and show my poems to him. Replied the poet.
CO-cLZl36nI--17," Oh, you are a poet. The king is kind."
CO-cLZl36nI--18,He will surely give you a prize.

CO-cLZl36nI--28,The poet agreed.

CO-cLZl36nI--33," The poet reached the last gate. The gatekeeper said,"
CO-cLZl36nI--34,I will allow you to see the king only if you give me half of the prize that you get.
CO-cLZl36nI--35,The poet had no other way.

CO-cLZl36nI--45,What? One hundred slaps?
CO-cLZl36nI--47,The king was shocked.
CO-cLZl36nI--48,What happened after that?
CO-cLZl36nI--49,Complete the story.
CO-cLZl36nI--50,What part of the prize did the poet get?
CO-cLZl36nI--51,There are three pictures on the page.

it4GglIkMLY--12,Shankaran wanted to know.
it4GglIkMLY--13,were they so excited? Somewhat impatiently...
it4GglIkMLY--14,His grandfather explained.
it4GglIkMLY--15,We can choose our own rulers today. How some men became
it4GglIkMLY--16,rulers
it4GglIkMLY--17,Choosing leaders or rulers by voting is something that has become common.
it4GglIkMLY--18,during the last 50 years or so.
it4GglIkMLY--19,How did men become rulers in the past? Some of...
it4GglIkMLY--20,the Rajas we read about in Chapter 4.
it4GglIkMLY--21,were probably chosen by the Jana. The people...
it4GglIkMLY--22,But...
it4GglIkMLY--23,around 3000 years ago.
it4GglIkMLY--24,We find some changes taking place in the ways...
it4GglIkMLY--25,in which Rajas were chosen.
it4GglIkMLY--26,Some men now become recognized as Rajas by performing very big sacrifices.
it4GglIkMLY--27,The Ashwamidha or horse sacrifice was one such ritual.
it4GglIkMLY--28,A horse was let loose to wander freely.
it4GglIkMLY--29,and it was guarded by the Rajas men.
it4GglIkMLY--30,If the horse wandered into the kingdoms of other Rajas and they stopped it.
it4GglIkMLY--31,They had to fight.
it4GglIkMLY--32," If they allowed the horse to pass, it meant that they accepted"
it4GglIkMLY--33,that the Raja who wanted to perform the sacrifice was stronger than them. These Rajas
it4GglIkMLY--34,would then invite it to the sacrifice.
it4GglIkMLY--35,which was performed by specially trained priests who were rewarded
it4GglIkMLY--36,with gifts. The Raja
it4GglIkMLY--37,who organized the sacrifice
it4GglIkMLY--38,was recognized as being
it4GglIkMLY--39,very powerful

it4GglIkMLY--96,Varnas
it4GglIkMLY--97," According to them, each Varna"
it4GglIkMLY--98,had a different set of functions.
it4GglIkMLY--99,The first Varna was that of the Brahmin.
it4GglIkMLY--100,Brahmins were expected to study and teach the Vedas.
it4GglIkMLY--101,perform sacrifices.

it4GglIkMLY--116,Women were also grouped with the Shuddras.
it4GglIkMLY--117,Both women and Shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. The priests
it4GglIkMLY--118,also said that these groups were decided
it4GglIkMLY--119," on the basis of birth. For example,"
it4GglIkMLY--120,if one's father and mother were Brahmins.
it4GglIkMLY--121,one would automatically become a Brahmin.
it4GglIkMLY--122,and soon.

it4GglIkMLY--128,Many people did not accept the system of Varna laid down by the Brahmins.
it4GglIkMLY--129,Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt...
it4GglIkMLY--130,that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna.
it4GglIkMLY--131,people belonged to.
it4GglIkMLY--132," Besides, some people felt..."
it4GglIkMLY--133,that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation.
it4GglIkMLY--134,Others felt.
it4GglIkMLY--135,that everybody should be able to perform rituals.
it4GglIkMLY--136,and others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also.
it4GglIkMLY--137," There were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the North East."
it4GglIkMLY--138,where social and economic differences were not very sharp.
it4GglIkMLY--139,and where the influence of the priests was limited. Why did people...
it4GglIkMLY--140,oppose the system of Varna's.
it4GglIkMLY--141,Jnipadhas
it4GglIkMLY--142,The Rajas
it4GglIkMLY--143,who performed these big sacrifices.
it4GglIkMLY--144,were now recognized as being Rajas of Janpadas

it4GglIkMLY--181,Mahajanpadas
it4GglIkMLY--182,about 2500 years ago.
it4GglIkMLY--183,Some Jhanpadas became more important than others and were known as Mahajanpadas. Some of these are shown.
it4GglIkMLY--184,on map 4.
it4GglIkMLY--185,Most Mahajanpadas had a capital city.
it4GglIkMLY--186,Many of these were fortified.
it4GglIkMLY--187," This means that huge walls of wood, brick or stone"

it4GglIkMLY--195,Protection
it4GglIkMLY--196,It is also likely that some rulers...
it4GglIkMLY--197,wanted to show how rich and powerful they were by building
it4GglIkMLY--198,really large tall
it4GglIkMLY--199,and impressive walls around their cities.

it4GglIkMLY--201,living inside the fortified area.
it4GglIkMLY--202,could be controlled more easily by the King.
it4GglIkMLY--203,Building such huge walls required a great deal of planning.
it4GglIkMLY--204,thousands if not lakhs of bricks or stones
it4GglIkMLY--205,had to be prepared.
it4GglIkMLY--206,This in turn meant enormous labour.
it4GglIkMLY--207,provided possibly by thousands of men?
it4GglIkMLY--208,women and children and resources
it4GglIkMLY--209," had to be found for all of this. On this page,"

it4GglIkMLY--222,List two ways in which the rajas of the Mahajanpadas were different from those.
it4GglIkMLY--223,mentioned in the Rigveda.
1-YUm865HA0--1,Taxes
1-YUm865HA0--2,as the rulers of the Mahajan padas were
1-YUm865HA0--3,Building huge forts
1-YUm865HA0--4," maintaining big armies, they needed more resources."
1-YUm865HA0--5,and the needed officials to collect these. So?
1-YUm865HA0--6,instead of depending on occasional gifts brought by people.
1-YUm865HA0--7," as in the case of the Raja of the Janapadas, they started collecting regular taxes"
1-YUm865HA0--8,Taxes on crops were the most important. This was because most people were farmers.
1-YUm865HA0--9,Usually the tax was fixed at 1/6th of what was produced.
1-YUm865HA0--10,Transplant
1-YUm865HA0--11," This was known as, Bhagas."
1-YUm865HA0--12,or a share
1-YUm865HA0--13,There were taxes on craftspersons as well.
1-YUm865HA0--14,These could have been in the form of labour.
1-YUm865HA0--15,for example a weaver or a smith
1-YUm865HA0--16,may have had to work for a day every month for the King.
1-YUm865HA0--17,Herders were also expected to pay taxes in the form of animals and animal produce.
1-YUm865HA0--18,There were also taxes on goods that were brought and sold.
1-YUm865HA0--19,through trade.
1-YUm865HA0--20,and hunters and gatherers also had to provide forest produce.
1-YUm865HA0--21,to the Raja. What do you think?
1-YUm865HA0--22,would have been provided by hunters?
1-YUm865HA0--23,and gatherers. Page Number.
1-YUm865HA0--24,52
1-YUm865HA0--25,changes in agriculture.
1-YUm865HA0--26,There were two major changes in agriculture around this time.
1-YUm865HA0--27,One was the growing use of iron ploughshares. This meant...
1-YUm865HA0--28,that heavy clayy soil.
1-YUm865HA0--29,could be turned over better than with the wooden plow share.
1-YUm865HA0--30,so that more grain could be produced.
1-YUm865HA0--31," Second, people began transplanting"
1-YUm865HA0--32,Paddy. This meant
1-YUm865HA0--33,that instead of scattering seed on the ground.
1-YUm865HA0--34,from which plants would sprout.
1-YUm865HA0--35,Sapplings were grown and then planted in the fields.
1-YUm865HA0--36,This led to increased production.
1-YUm865HA0--37," as many more plants survived. However,"
1-YUm865HA0--38,It was backbreaking work.
1-YUm865HA0--39," Generally, slave men and women."
1-YUm865HA0--41,Dasas and Dasis.
1-YUm865HA0--42,and landless agricultural labourers.
1-YUm865HA0--43,Kamakaras had to do this work.
1-YUm865HA0--45,Can you think why kings would encourage these changes?

1-YUm865HA0--64,carts

1-YUm865HA0--88,refused. They were scared.
1-YUm865HA0--89," as they had heard that the rulers of India had vast armies of foot soldiers, chariots and elephants."
1-YUm865HA0--90,in what ways were these armies different from those described in the Rigveda?
1-YUm865HA0--92," A close look, B, vajji."

810SSaIhMMs--146,Children should understand the need for a scale.
810SSaIhMMs--148,We need to discuss that when we show a big area on paper.
810SSaIhMMs--149,We have to reduce it by a fixed ratio everywhere.

jXYcAvK7MTA--1,How were these kingdoms administered?
jXYcAvK7MTA--2," As in the case of earlier kings, land revenue..."
jXYcAvK7MTA--3,remained important for these rulers and the village
jXYcAvK7MTA--4,remained the basic unit of administration.
jXYcAvK7MTA--5,There were some new developments as well.
jXYcAvK7MTA--6,Kings adopted a number of steps.
jXYcAvK7MTA--7,to win the support of men who were powerful.
jXYcAvK7MTA--8,either economically or socially or because of their political and military strength. For instance.
jXYcAvK7MTA--9,Some important administrative posts were now hereditary.
jXYcAvK7MTA--10,This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts.
jXYcAvK7MTA--11," For example,"
jXYcAvK7MTA--12,The poet Harishena
jXYcAvK7MTA--13,was a Mahadandaniyak or Chief Judicial Officer.
jXYcAvK7MTA--14," like his father. Sometimes,"
jXYcAvK7MTA--15,One person held many offices.
jXYcAvK7MTA--16," For instance, besides being a Mahadhan Dinayak."
jXYcAvK7MTA--17,Harishena
jXYcAvK7MTA--18,was a kumar-amatya

jXYcAvK7MTA--20, and a sandhi-vigrahika
jXYcAvK7MTA--22,Meaning a Minister of War?
jXYcAvK7MTA--23," and peace. Besides, important men."
jXYcAvK7MTA--24,Probably had a say in local administration. These included...
jXYcAvK7MTA--25,The nagarashreshthi
jXYcAvK7MTA--26,or chief banker or merchant of the city.
jXYcAvK7MTA--27,The Sarth Vaha or Leader
jXYcAvK7MTA--28,of the merchant caravans. The prathama-kulika
jXYcAvK7MTA--29,or the chief craftsman.
jXYcAvK7MTA--30,and the head of the kayasthas or scribes.
jXYcAvK7MTA--32,These policies were reasonably effective.
jXYcAvK7MTA--33," But sooner or later, some of these powerful men..."
jXYcAvK7MTA--34,grew strong enough to set up independent kingdoms.
jXYcAvK7MTA--36,What do you think may have been the advantages and disadvantages of having hereditary officers?
jXYcAvK7MTA--37,page number 109.
jXYcAvK7MTA--38,a new kind of army.
jXYcAvK7MTA--39," Like earlier rulers, some of these kings maintained a well-organized army. With elephants..."
jXYcAvK7MTA--40,chariots
jXYcAvK7MTA--41,Cavalry
jXYcAvK7MTA--42,and foot soldiers besides
jXYcAvK7MTA--43,There were military leaders who provided the king with troops whenever he needed them.
jXYcAvK7MTA--44,They were not paid regular salaries.
jXYcAvK7MTA--45," Instead, some of them."
jXYcAvK7MTA--46,received grants of land.
jXYcAvK7MTA--47,They collected revenue from the land.
jXYcAvK7MTA--48,and used this to maintain soldiers and horses and provide equipment for warfare.
jXYcAvK7MTA--49,These men were known as samantas.
jXYcAvK7MTA--50,Whenever the ruler was weak.
jXYcAvK7MTA--51,samantas try to become...
jXYcAvK7MTA--52,Independent.
jXYcAvK7MTA--53,assemblies in the southern kingdoms.
jXYcAvK7MTA--54,The inscriptions of the Pallavas mention a number of local assemblies. These included the sabha.
jXYcAvK7MTA--56,which was an assembly of Brahmin-land owners. This assembly functioned through sub
jXYcAvK7MTA--57,committees which looked after irrigation.
jXYcAvK7MTA--58," agricultural operations, making routes."
jXYcAvK7MTA--59,local temples etc. The Ur was a village assembly.
jXYcAvK7MTA--60,"found in areas where the land owners were not Brahmins, and the nagaram"
jXYcAvK7MTA--61,was an organization of merchants. It is likely that these assemblies
jXYcAvK7MTA--62,were controlled by rich and powerful land owners and merchants.
jXYcAvK7MTA--63,Many of these local assemblies continued to function for centuries.
jXYcAvK7MTA--64,ordinary people in the kingdoms.
jXYcAvK7MTA--65,We can catch an occasional glimpse of the lives of ordinary people from place.
jXYcAvK7MTA--66,and other accounts.
jXYcAvK7MTA--67,Let us look at some of these.
jXYcAvK7MTA--68,Kalidas
jXYcAvK7MTA--69," is known for his plays, depicting life in the King's court."
jXYcAvK7MTA--70,An interesting feature about these plays is that the King and most Brahmins are shown
jXYcAvK7MTA--71,as speaking Sanskrit.
jXYcAvK7MTA--72,while women and men other than the king and Brahmin's use prakrit. His most famous play.
jXYcAvK7MTA--74,Abhijnana Shakuntalam
jXYcAvK7MTA--75,is the story of the love between a king named Dushyanta and a young woman named
jXYcAvK7MTA--76,Shakuntala
jXYcAvK7MTA--77,We find an interesting description of the plight of a poor fisherman in this plea. A fisherman finds a ring.
jXYcAvK7MTA--79,A fisherman found a precious ring.
jXYcAvK7MTA--80,which the King had given to Shakuntala.
jXYcAvK7MTA--81,but which had been accidentally swallowed by a fish. When he went to the palace with it...
jXYcAvK7MTA--82,The gate men accused him of theft.
jXYcAvK7MTA--83,and the chief police officer was rather rude. however
jXYcAvK7MTA--84,The king was happy when he saw the ring and sent a reward for the fisherman.
jXYcAvK7MTA--85,Then the police officer and the gate men decided to take a share of the reward.
jXYcAvK7MTA--86,and went along with the fisherman to have a drink.
jXYcAvK7MTA--88," Do you think that if a poor man finds something and reports this to the police, he would be treated like this today? Name a famous man."
jXYcAvK7MTA--89,who taught in Prakrit and a king.
jXYcAvK7MTA--90,who issued inscriptions in prakrit.

jXYcAvK7MTA--99," If such a man enters a town or a marketplace, he strikes a piece of wood."

jXYcAvK7MTA--102,what it means and avoid touching him or brushing against him.
jXYcAvK7MTA--103,and Banabhatta

Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--3,The shepherd's treasure. The synopsis
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--4,for the first part of this story.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--5,A poor shepherd once lived in Iran.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--6," Though uneducated, he was very wise and helpful."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--7,The king decided to meet him in disguise. Now the story 
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--8,in a village in Iran.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--9,Their ones lived a shepherd. He was very poor.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--10,He did not have even a small cottage of his own.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--11,He had never been to school or learned to read and write.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--12,for there were very few schools in those days.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--13,though poor and uneducated.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--14,This shepherd was very wise.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--15,He understood people's sorrows and troubles and helped them phase their problems with courage and common sense.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--16,Many people came to him for advice.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--17,Soon he became famous for his wisdom and friendly nature.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--18,The king of that country heard about him and thought of meeting him.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--19," disguised as a shepherd and riding on a mule, one day the king came to the cave where the wise shepherd lived."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--21,As soon as the shepherd saw the traveler coming towards the cave.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--22,He rose to welcome him.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--23," He took the tired traveller inside the cave, gave him water to drink, and a share of his own meager meal."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--24,The king rested for the night in the cave and was greatly impressed by the shepherd hospitality and wise conversation.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--25,Now the synopsis of the next part of the story.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--26,The Shefford was able to make out that his visitor was none other than the King.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--27," The king made the wise, shepherd governor of a small district."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--28,Other governors became jealous of the new governor.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--29,and called him dishonest.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--30," Though still tired, the king decided to depart the next morning. He said,"
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--31,Many thanks for your kindness to a poor traveler.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--32,I have a long way to go.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--33,Permit me to leave.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--34," Looking straight into the eyes of the guest, the shepherd replied,"
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--35," Thank you, Your Majesty."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--36,for paying me the compliment of a visit.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--37,The king was astonished as well as pleased.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--38," He is indeed very wise, he thought to himself, I need people like him to work for me."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--39," and the king appointed this humble shepherd, the governor of a small district."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--41," Although he rose to power and dignity, the Shefford remained as humble as ever."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--42," people loved and honoured him for his wisdom, sympathy and goodness."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--43,He was kind and just to one and all. His fame as a fear.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--44,and wise governor soon spread throughout the country.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--45,Now the governors of other provinces grew terribly jealous of him and began to talk to the king against him. The said
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--46,He is very dishonest and keeps for himself part of the money that he collects as text from the people.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--47,Why did he always carry with him?
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--48,the added and iron chest.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--49,Perhaps he carried in it the treasure that he had secretly collected.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--50," After all, they said mockingly."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--51,He was an ordinary shepherd and could behave no better.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--52,page number nine
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--53,Now the synopsis of the next part of the story.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--54,The new governor was called to the palace.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--55,He was ordered to explain why he always carried an iron chest.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--56,They chest contained no gold or silver.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--57,Now the next part of this story.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--58," At first, the king did not pay attention to these reports, but how long could he ignore these governors and their endless stories about the shepherd?"
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--59," One thing was certain, the king discovered. The new governor did carry an iron chest with him all the time."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--60," So, one day the new governor was summoned to the palace."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--61,He came riding on his camel.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--62," And to everyone's delight, the famous iron chest was there, fastened securely behind him on the camel's back."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--64,Now the king was angry. He thundered.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--65,Why do you always carry that iron just with you?
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--66,What does it contain?
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--67,The Governor smiled.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--68,He asked his servant to bring in the chest.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--69,How eagerly the people standing around waited for the shepherd to be found out.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--70,but how great was their astonishment and even of the king himself when the chest was opened.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--71," No go the silver, or jewels."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--72,But an old blanket was all that came out.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--73,page number 11
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--74," holding it up proudly, the shepherd's said. This my dear master is my only treasure."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--75,I always carry it with me.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--76,But why do you carry such an ordinary blanket with you?
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--77,Surely you are the governor of a district.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--78,The King asked.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--79,to which the shepherd replied with quiet dignity.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--80,this blanket
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--81,He's my oldest friend.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--82,It will still protect me if at any time your majesty should wish to take away my new cloaks.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--83," How pleased the King was, and how embarrassed the jealous governors became to hear the wise man's reply."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--84," Now, they knew."
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--85,that the shuffled was indeed the humblest and the wisest man in the land.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--86,The King made him the governor of a much bigger district that very day.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--87,This story has been taken from an Iranian folk tale.
Zc2bgIDZ-Ks--88,Thanks for watching
jWhxkVoqig8--0,Activity 5
jWhxkVoqig8--1,We will require a herb. Two trans-
jWhxkVoqig8--2,parent polythene bags
jWhxkVoqig8--3,and thread.
jWhxkVoqig8--4,Do this activity during daytime on a sunny day.
jWhxkVoqig8--5,Use a healthy well-watered plant that has been growing in the sun.
jWhxkVoqig8--6,and close a leafy branch of the plant.
jWhxkVoqig8--7,in a polythene cover.
jWhxkVoqig8--8,and tie up its mouth.
jWhxkVoqig8--9,as shown in figure 7.11.
jWhxkVoqig8--10,Tie up the mouth of another empty polythene cover.
jWhxkVoqig8--11,and keep it also in the sun.
jWhxkVoqig8--12," After a few hours, observe the inner..."
jWhxkVoqig8--13,surface of the covers.
jWhxkVoqig8--14,What do you see?
jWhxkVoqig8--15,Are there any droplets of water?
jWhxkVoqig8--16,How do you think they got there?
jWhxkVoqig8--17,Don't forget to remove the polythene bag.
jWhxkVoqig8--18,after the activity.
jWhxkVoqig8--19,Water comes out of leaves.
jWhxkVoqig8--20,...in the form of vapour...
jWhxkVoqig8--21,by a process called transpiration.
jWhxkVoqig8--22,Plants release a lot of water into the air.
jWhxkVoqig8--23,Through this process.
jWhxkVoqig8--24,We will learn more about this.
jWhxkVoqig8--25,In Chapter 14.
jWhxkVoqig8--26,Why do we tie a cover around the leaves?
jWhxkVoqig8--27,Would we have seen?
jWhxkVoqig8--28,The water evaporates if we had not tied a polythene cover.
jWhxkVoqig8--29,What makes the water appear on the polythene bag?
jWhxkVoqig8--30,In Chapter 5 we noticed water changing into different forms in some of our activities.
jWhxkVoqig8--31,Can you think of these and name the process that makes?
jWhxkVoqig8--32,Water drops appear on the polythene cover.
jWhxkVoqig8--33,Leaves also have another function. Let us study this.
jWhxkVoqig8--34,Figure 7.12
jWhxkVoqig8--35,What does the leaf do?
jWhxkVoqig8--36,Activity 6
jWhxkVoqig8--37,We will require a leaf
jWhxkVoqig8--38,Spirit
jWhxkVoqig8--39,A beaker
jWhxkVoqig8--40,test tube
jWhxkVoqig8--41,Burner
jWhxkVoqig8--42,Water
jWhxkVoqig8--43,a watch glass
jWhxkVoqig8--45,Take a leaf in a test tube
jWhxkVoqig8--46,and poor spirit.
jWhxkVoqig8--47,to completely immerse the leaf.
jWhxkVoqig8--48,Figure 7.12 shows what does the leaf contain.
jWhxkVoqig8--49,Page 57.
jWhxkVoqig8--50,Note
jWhxkVoqig8--51,Since the activity involves...
jWhxkVoqig8--52,the use of spirit and heating.
jWhxkVoqig8--53,It is advised that it is demonstrated by the teacher in the class. Now
jWhxkVoqig8--54,Place the test tube in a beaker
jWhxkVoqig8--55,How filled with water?
jWhxkVoqig8--56,Heat the beaker till all the green colour from the leaf comes out into the spirit in the test tube.
jWhxkVoqig8--57,Take out the leaf carefully.
jWhxkVoqig8--58,and wash it in water.
jWhxkVoqig8--59,Place it on a watch glass.
jWhxkVoqig8--60,and pour some iodine solution over it.
jWhxkVoqig8--61,Figure 7.13
jWhxkVoqig8--62,What do you observe?
jWhxkVoqig8--63,Compare your observations with those done in chapter 2.
jWhxkVoqig8--64, When you test it for
jWhxkVoqig8--65,for presence of different nutrients.
jWhxkVoqig8--67,Does this mean that the leaf has...
jWhxkVoqig8--68,starch in it.
jWhxkVoqig8--69," In chapter 2, we saw that"
jWhxkVoqig8--70,A slice of raw potato also shows the presence of starch.
jWhxkVoqig8--71,But potatoes get their starch
jWhxkVoqig8--72,from their leaves and store it.
jWhxkVoqig8--73,Leaves prepare their food
jWhxkVoqig8--74,in the presence of sunlight.
jWhxkVoqig8--75,and a green colored substance present in them.
jWhxkVoqig8--76," For this, they also use water."
jWhxkVoqig8--77,and carbon dioxide.
jWhxkVoqig8--78,This process is called photosynthesis. This process is called photosynthesis.
jWhxkVoqig8--79,Oxygen is given out in this process.
jWhxkVoqig8--80,The food prepared by leaves ultimately.
jWhxkVoqig8--81,Get stored in different parts of plant.
jWhxkVoqig8--83,We have seen
jWhxkVoqig8--84,that the stem supplies leaf with water.
jWhxkVoqig8--85,The leaf uses the water to make food.
jWhxkVoqig8--86,the leaves also lose water through transpiration.
jWhxkVoqig8--87,How do they stem and leaves get water?
jWhxkVoqig8--88,that is where the roots come in.
jWhxkVoqig8--89,7.4
jWhxkVoqig8--90,root
jWhxkVoqig8--91,Look at figures 7.13.
jWhxkVoqig8--92,Who do you think is watering their plant correctly?
jWhxkVoqig8--93,Pahili or boojho? why
jWhxkVoqig8--94,which part of the plant is in the soil.
jWhxkVoqig8--95,Let us learn more about this part from the following activities.
jWhxkVoqig8--96," Figure 7.13, watering the plants."
jWhxkVoqig8--97,Activity 7
jWhxkVoqig8--98,You would require...
jWhxkVoqig8--99,two pots
jWhxkVoqig8--100,some soil
jWhxkVoqig8--101,Khurpe for digging
jWhxkVoqig8--102,Blade or a pair of scissors.
jWhxkVoqig8--103,and water.
jWhxkVoqig8--104,This activity is to be done in groups of four or five students.
jWhxkVoqig8--105,Select two plants of the same kind.
jWhxkVoqig8--106,From an open ground
jWhxkVoqig8--107,and dig them out with roots.
jWhxkVoqig8--108,Take care that their roots do not break.
jWhxkVoqig8--110,Plant one of them in pot E.
jWhxkVoqig8--111,as shown in figure 7.14A.
jWhxkVoqig8--112,Cut off the roots from the other plant.
jWhxkVoqig8--113,and plant it in pot B.
jWhxkVoqig8--114,as shown in figure 7.14b.
jWhxkVoqig8--115,Figure 7.14A plant with roots and figure 7.14B without roots.
jWhxkVoqig8--116,page 58.
jWhxkVoqig8--117,Water them regularly.
jWhxkVoqig8--118,Observe the plants after a week.
jWhxkVoqig8--119,are both plants healthy.
jWhxkVoqig8--120,Both the plants are watered regularly.
jWhxkVoqig8--121," But one is without roots, isn't it?"
jWhxkVoqig8--122,Does this activity help you understand an important function of the root?
jWhxkVoqig8--123,Let us do an activity to study another function of root.
jWhxkVoqig8--124,Activity 8
jWhxkVoqig8--125,We would require
jWhxkVoqig8--126,Seeds of gram and maize.
jWhxkVoqig8--127,cotton wool cotton wool
jWhxkVoqig8--128,and some water.
jWhxkVoqig8--129,Take two katoris.
jWhxkVoqig8--130,Place some wet cotton in them.
jWhxkVoqig8--131,Put 3 or 4 seeds of gram in one and maze in the other.
jWhxkVoqig8--132,Keep the cotton wet by sprinkling water every day.
jWhxkVoqig8--133,until the sprouts have grown into young plants. Bye bye and until the end.
jWhxkVoqig8--134,After a week.

jWhxkVoqig8--137,Was it easy to separate the cotton from the roots?
jWhxkVoqig8--138,Why?
jWhxkVoqig8--139,in Activity 6.
jWhxkVoqig8--140," We could not pull out the plants from the soil, right?"
jWhxkVoqig8--141,We dug them out.
jWhxkVoqig8--142,This is because...
jWhxkVoqig8--143,Roots help in holding the plant.
jWhxkVoqig8--144,firmly to the side.
jWhxkVoqig8--145,They anchor the plant to the soil.
jWhxkVoqig8--146,You have seen that there are different kinds of stems and leaves.
jWhxkVoqig8--147,Do the roots also show a variety?
jWhxkVoqig8--148,Let us find out.
jWhxkVoqig8--149,Figure 7.15 shows young plants grown on cotton.
jWhxkVoqig8--150,Activity 8. Study Figure 7.17
jWhxkVoqig8--151,and
jWhxkVoqig8--152,& be carefully
jWhxkVoqig8--153," Now, look at the roots of the ground plants."
jWhxkVoqig8--154,You have pulled out from the cotton in the previous activity.
jWhxkVoqig8--155,Do they look like the roots shown in figure 7.168?
jWhxkVoqig8--156,or those in figure 7.16b.
jWhxkVoqig8--157,How about the roots of mace plant?
jWhxkVoqig8--158," write, gram or maze in the blank spaces in the figure after matching the rules with the figures."
jWhxkVoqig8--159,Figures 7.16A Roots of Blank Figures 7.16B Roots of Blank
jWhxkVoqig8--160,In what way are the roots of gram and maize similar?
jWhxkVoqig8--161,In what way are they different?
jWhxkVoqig8--162,There seem to be two different types of roots.
jWhxkVoqig8--163,Is it?
jWhxkVoqig8--164,Are there also other types of fruits?
jWhxkVoqig8--165,Let us find out.
jWhxkVoqig8--166,Activity 10
jWhxkVoqig8--167,Go to an open ground where many wild plants are growing.
jWhxkVoqig8--168,Dig out of you.
jWhxkVoqig8--169,Wash the soil of the roots
jWhxkVoqig8--170,and observe them. Do you find that...
jWhxkVoqig8--171,All of them have either the kind of root
jWhxkVoqig8--172,shown in figure
jWhxkVoqig8--173,7.17A
jWhxkVoqig8--174,or as in figure 7.17b?
jWhxkVoqig8--175,page 59.
jWhxkVoqig8--176," For roots of the kind shown in figure 7.17a,"
jWhxkVoqig8--177,The main route is called
jWhxkVoqig8--178,Tap root.
jWhxkVoqig8--179,and the smaller roots are called
jWhxkVoqig8--180,Lateral roots
jWhxkVoqig8--181,Plants with roots as shown in figure 7.17B.
jWhxkVoqig8--182,Do not have a main root.
jWhxkVoqig8--183,All roots seem similar and these are called.
jWhxkVoqig8--184,Fibres Roots
jWhxkVoqig8--185,Figure 7.17a Taproot
jWhxkVoqig8--186," and B, Fibrous Roots. Separate the plants you have collected into two groups."
jWhxkVoqig8--187," In group A, put those that have tap roots, and in group B,"
jWhxkVoqig8--188,those that have fibrous roots.
jWhxkVoqig8--189,Look at the leaves of the plants in group A.
jWhxkVoqig8--190,What kind of Venation do they have?
jWhxkVoqig8--191,What kind of Venation do you see for plans of Group B?
jWhxkVoqig8--192," Do you notice that leaf, venation and the type of roots in a plant?"
jWhxkVoqig8--193,are related in a very interesting way.
jWhxkVoqig8--194,In table 7.3
jWhxkVoqig8--195,Can you match the type of leaf venation and the type of roots?
jWhxkVoqig8--196,For some plants you have studied in all the activities so far?
jWhxkVoqig8--197,Bucho has a brilliant idea.
jWhxkVoqig8--198,If he wants to know what kind of fruits a plant has.
jWhxkVoqig8--199,He need not pull it out. He just has to look at its leaves.
jWhxkVoqig8--200,Table 7.3
jWhxkVoqig8--201,types of roots.
jWhxkVoqig8--202,and types of leaf venation.
jWhxkVoqig8--203,There are three columns.
jWhxkVoqig8--204,name of the plant
jWhxkVoqig8--205,Type of leaf venation in and
jWhxkVoqig8--206,type of roots.
jWhxkVoqig8--207,Fill this table yourself according to your observation.
jWhxkVoqig8--208,We have learnt.
jWhxkVoqig8--209,that roots absorb water.
jWhxkVoqig8--210,and minerals from the soil.
jWhxkVoqig8--211,and the stem conducts these to leaves and other parts of the plant.
jWhxkVoqig8--212,The leaves prepare food. This food travels through the...
jWhxkVoqig8--213,and is stored in different parts of plant.
jWhxkVoqig8--214,We eat some of these as roots. Like at it.

jWhxkVoqig8--216,Sweet potato
jWhxkVoqig8--217,turnip
jWhxkVoqig8--218,and tapioca
jWhxkVoqig8--219,We also eat many other parts of a plant where food is stored. Do you agree that's a...

8YFALsHOQQY--57,Give me for this the man wrote.
8YFALsHOQQY--58,Ray noticed a little shame.
8YFALsHOQQY--59,and the grey eyes looking at him.
8YFALsHOQQY--60,The watch was nothing special and yet...
8YFALsHOQQY--61,had great powers.
8YFALsHOQQY--62," It was something to exchange, a way out of a bad situation."
8YFALsHOQQY--63,Knowing that great need had brought the man...
8YFALsHOQQY--64,to his shop in the first place. Ray asked
8YFALsHOQQY--65,How much do you need for it?
8YFALsHOQQY--66," The reply came back on the Notepad, whatever it is worth."
8YFALsHOQQY--67,Ray reached into his cash box.
8YFALsHOQQY--68,pulled out a $50 note and passed it
8YFALsHOQQY--69,into the man's hand. As they shook hands.
8YFALsHOQQY--70,Ray looked into the man's eyes.
8YFALsHOQQY--71," They seemed to say, thank you. Page number 14."
8YFALsHOQQY--72," They both knew the watch wasn't worth that much. Before turning to leave,"
8YFALsHOQQY--73,The man wrote.
8YFALsHOQQY--74,I'll be back to pick it up as soon as I can. Merry Christmas.
8YFALsHOQQY--75,The little story ended on the half hour.
8YFALsHOQQY--76,when the clocks strike in all together.
8YFALsHOQQY--77,The timepieces which had been looking on silently all the while.
8YFALsHOQQY--78,rang out the time with such feeling that even Ray thought he could hear them.
8YFALsHOQQY--79,Their sweet musical message was filled with hope.
8YFALsHOQQY--80," The timeless message of peace on earth, goodwill towards all, was felt by the three men who stood in the old clock shop."
8YFALsHOQQY--81,Question number one.
8YFALsHOQQY--82,What made Ray think the visitor was not really a shopper? Question number two.
8YFALsHOQQY--83,Why do you think he had come to the shop? Question number three.
8YFALsHOQQY--84,How did Ray communicate with him? Question number four.
8YFALsHOQQY--85,What do you think the man said to his friend who waited at the door?
8YFALsHOQQY--86,Blank
8YFALsHOQQY--87,Question number five.
8YFALsHOQQY--88,A ray was not a pawnbrooker. Why then?
8YFALsHOQQY--89,Did he lend money to people in exchange for their old watches?
8YFALsHOQQY--90,watches and clocks.
8YFALsHOQQY--91,Question number six.
8YFALsHOQQY--92,The watch was nothing special.
8YFALsHOQQY--93,and yet had great powers. In what sense did it have great powers?
8YFALsHOQQY--94,Question number seven.
8YFALsHOQQY--95,Do you think the man would ever come back to pick up the watch?
8YFALsHOQQY--96,And question number eight.
8YFALsHOQQY--97,When did the unfriendly face of the visitor turn truly friendly?

N7O_KBF1Qqc--13,Look at the pictures in this unit and guess in what way
N7O_KBF1Qqc--14,This school may be different from other schools.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--15,1
N7O_KBF1Qqc--16,I had heard a great deal about miss Beam's school.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--17,But not till last week did the chance come to visit it.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--19,2
N7O_KBF1Qqc--20," When I arrived, there was no one inside."
N7O_KBF1Qqc--21,but a girl of about 12. her eyes were covered with
N7O_KBF1Qqc--22,a bandage.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--23,And she was being led carefully between the flower beds by a little boy who was about four years younger.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--24,She stopped and it looked like she asked him who had come.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--25,He seemed to be describing me to her.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--26,Then they passed on.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--27," In the box, there was which you may not know. In sight means to be seen."
N7O_KBF1Qqc--28,Page 57.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--29,3
N7O_KBF1Qqc--30,Miss Beam was all that I had expected.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--31," Middle-aged, full of authority."
N7O_KBF1Qqc--32,yet kindly and understanding.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--33,Her hair was beginning to turn grey.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--34,and she had the kind of plump figure that is likely to be comforting to a homesick child.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--35,I asked her some questions about her teaching methods.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--36,which I had heard were simple.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--38,4
N7O_KBF1Qqc--39,No more than is needed to help them to learn.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--40,"How to do things simple spelling, adding,"
N7O_KBF1Qqc--41," Subtracting, Multiplying and Writing"
N7O_KBF1Qqc--42,The rest is done by reading to them and by interesting talks during which they have to sit still and keep their hands quiet.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--43,There are practically no other lessons.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--44,5
N7O_KBF1Qqc--45,The real aim of this school is not so much to teach thought.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--46," as to teach thoughtfulness, kindness to others and being responsible citizens."
N7O_KBF1Qqc--47,Look out of the window a minute. Will you?
N7O_KBF1Qqc--49,Six.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--50,I went to the window which overlooked a large garden and a playground at the back.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--51,What
N7O_KBF1Qqc--52,Do you see? Miss Beam asked
N7O_KBF1Qqc--54,Some difficult words.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--55,in the box kindly.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--56,Kindly means friendly.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--57,Plump
N7O_KBF1Qqc--58," Stout, Pleasantly Fat"
N7O_KBF1Qqc--59,responsible.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--60,aware of their duties.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--61,Page 58.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--62,7
N7O_KBF1Qqc--63," I see some very beautiful grounds, I said and a lot of jolly children."
N7O_KBF1Qqc--64,It pains me though to see that they are not all so healthy and active looking.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--65," When I came in, I saw one poor little girl."
N7O_KBF1Qqc--66,Being led about.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--67,She has some trouble with her eyes.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--68,Now I can see two more with the same difficulty.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--69,and there's a girl with a crutch watching the others at play.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--70,She seems to be a hopeless cripple.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--72,8
N7O_KBF1Qqc--73,Miss Beam laughed.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--74," Oh no, she said."
N7O_KBF1Qqc--75,She's not really lame.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--76,This is only her lame day.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--77,The others are not blind either. It is only their blind
N7O_KBF1Qqc--78,day
N7O_KBF1Qqc--79,I must have looked very surprised.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--80,for she laughed again.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--81,9
N7O_KBF1Qqc--82,This is a very important part of our system.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--83,To make our children appreciate and understand
N7O_KBF1Qqc--84,Misfortune.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--85,We make them share in misfortune too.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--86,Each term every child has
N7O_KBF1Qqc--87,One blind day.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--88,one lame day
N7O_KBF1Qqc--89,one deaf day
N7O_KBF1Qqc--90,one injured day
N7O_KBF1Qqc--91,and one dumb day
N7O_KBF1Qqc--92,During the blind day their eyes are bandaged absolutely.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--93,and they are on their honor not to peep.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--94,The bandage is put on overnight so they wake blind. This means...
N7O_KBF1Qqc--95,that they need help with everything.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--96,Other children are given the duty of helping them.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--97,and leading them about.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--98,They all learn so much this way.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--99,both the blind and the helpers.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--100,Words in the box are?
N7O_KBF1Qqc--101,At play means playing.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--102,Hopeless
N7O_KBF1Qqc--103,means unfortunate or without hope.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--104,Lame day
N7O_KBF1Qqc--105,Day on which she acts as if...
N7O_KBF1Qqc--106,She was lame.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--107,misfortune
N7O_KBF1Qqc--108,Unfortunate condition or bad luck.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--109,Their eyes
N7O_KBF1Qqc--110,are bandaged.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--111,They are blind folded. Are on their...
N7O_KBF1Qqc--112,honor
N7O_KBF1Qqc--113,Have promised page
N7O_KBF1Qqc--114,59
N7O_KBF1Qqc--115,10
N7O_KBF1Qqc--116,"There is no misery about it, Miss Beam continued"
N7O_KBF1Qqc--117,Everyone is very kind and it is really something of a game.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--118,Before the day is over
N7O_KBF1Qqc--119,Though even the most thoughtless child.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--120,realises what misfortune is.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--121,eleven
N7O_KBF1Qqc--122," The blind day is, of course, really the worst."
N7O_KBF1Qqc--123,But some of the children tell me that the dumb day is the most difficult.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--124," We cannot bandage the children's mouths, so they really have to exercise their willpower."
N7O_KBF1Qqc--126,Come into the garden and see for yourself how the children feel about it.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--127,12
N7O_KBF1Qqc--128,Miss Beam led me to one of the bandaged girls. Here's a gentleman.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--129," Come to talk to you, said Miss Beam and left us."
N7O_KBF1Qqc--130,13
N7O_KBF1Qqc--131, Don't you ever peep? I asked the girl.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--132," Oh no, she explained."
N7O_KBF1Qqc--133,That would be cheating.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--134,But I had no idea it was so awful to be blind.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--135,You can't see a thing. You feel you are going to...
N7O_KBF1Qqc--136,to be hit by something every moment.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--137,It's such a relief just to sit down.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--138,Are your helpers kind to you? I asked.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--140,14
N7O_KBF1Qqc--141," Fairly, but they are not as careful as I shall be."
N7O_KBF1Qqc--142,when it is my turn.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--143,Those that have been blind already are the best helpers.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--144,It is perfectly ghastly not to see. I wish you'd try.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--145,Shall I lead you anywhere? I asked.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--146,Words in the box.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--147,misery
N7O_KBF1Qqc--148,"means difficulty, unpleasantness."
N7O_KBF1Qqc--149,"thoughtless, careless"
N7O_KBF1Qqc--151,Come to talk.
N7O_KBF1Qqc--152,Who has come to talk
N7O_KBF1Qqc--153,awful means bad
pwnPigO4MuM--1,Evaporation
pwnPigO4MuM--2,Activity 6
pwnPigO4MuM--3,Add 2 spoons of salt to water in another beaker and stir it well.
pwnPigO4MuM--4,Do you see any change in the color of water?
pwnPigO4MuM--5,Can you see any salt in the beaker after stirring?
pwnPigO4MuM--6,Heat the beaker containing the salt water. Figure 5.11.
pwnPigO4MuM--7,Let the water boil away. What is left in the beaker?
pwnPigO4MuM--8," In this activity, we used the process of evaporation to separate a mixture of water and salt."
pwnPigO4MuM--9,The process of conversion of water into its vapor is called evaporation.
pwnPigO4MuM--10,The process of evaporation takes place continuously wherever water is present.
pwnPigO4MuM--11,Where do you think salt comes from?
pwnPigO4MuM--12,Sea water contains many salts mixed in it. One of these salts is the common salt.
pwnPigO4MuM--13," When sea water is allowed to stand in shallow pits, water gets heated by sunlight and slowly turns into water vapor through evaporation."
pwnPigO4MuM--14," In a few days, the water evaporates completely."
pwnPigO4MuM--15,Leaving behind the solid salts.
pwnPigO4MuM--16,Figure 5.12
pwnPigO4MuM--17,Common salt is then obtained from this mixture of salts by further purification.
pwnPigO4MuM--18,Page 41
pwnPigO4MuM--19,Figure 5.12
pwnPigO4MuM--20,shows obtaining salt from sea water.
pwnPigO4MuM--21,Use of more than one method of separation.
pwnPigO4MuM--22,We have studied some methods for separation of substances from their mixtures.
pwnPigO4MuM--23," Often, one method is not sufficient to separate the different substances present in a mixture."
pwnPigO4MuM--24," In such a situation, we need to use more than one of these methods."
pwnPigO4MuM--25,Activity 7
pwnPigO4MuM--26,Take a mixture of sand and salt. How will we separate these?
pwnPigO4MuM--27,We already saw that hand picking would not be a practical method.
pwnPigO4MuM--28,for separating these.
pwnPigO4MuM--29,Keep this mixture in a beaker and add some water to it. Leave the beaker aside for some time.
pwnPigO4MuM--30,Do you see the sand settling down at the bottom?
pwnPigO4MuM--31,The sand can be separated by decantation or filtration.
pwnPigO4MuM--32,What does the decanted liquid contain? Do you think?
pwnPigO4MuM--33,This water contains the salt which was there in the mixture at the beginning.
pwnPigO4MuM--34,Now we need to separate salt and water from the decanted liquid.
pwnPigO4MuM--35,Transfer this liquid to a kettle and close its lid.
pwnPigO4MuM--36,Heat the cattle for some time.
pwnPigO4MuM--37,Do you notice steam coming out from the spout of the kettle?
pwnPigO4MuM--38,Take a metal plate with some ice on it.
pwnPigO4MuM--39,Hold the plate just above the spout of the kettle as shown in figure 5.13. What do you observe?
pwnPigO4MuM--40,Let all the water in the kettle boil off.
pwnPigO4MuM--41," When the steam comes in contact with the metal plate cooled with ice, it condenses and forms liquid water."
pwnPigO4MuM--42,The water drops that you observed falling from the plate were
pwnPigO4MuM--43,due to condensation of steam.
pwnPigO4MuM--44,The process of conversion of water vapor into its liquid form is called condensation.
pwnPigO4MuM--45,Did you ever see water drops condensed under a...
pwnPigO4MuM--46,plate that has been used to cover a vessel containing milk that has just been boiled.
pwnPigO4MuM--47," After all the water has evaporated, what is left behind in the kettle? We have thus"
pwnPigO4MuM--48," separated salt, sand and water using processes of decantation."

pwnPigO4MuM--53,Paheli faced a problem while recovering salt mixed with sand.
pwnPigO4MuM--54,She has mixed a packet of salt in a small amount of sand.
pwnPigO4MuM--55,Page 42
pwnPigO4MuM--56,She then tried the method suggested in Activity 7 to recover the salt.
pwnPigO4MuM--57," She found, however, that she could recover only a small part of the salt that she had taken What could have gone wrong?"
pwnPigO4MuM--59,Can water dissolve any amount of a substance?
pwnPigO4MuM--60,In Chapter 4
pwnPigO4MuM--61,We found that many substances dissolve in water and form a solution.
pwnPigO4MuM--62,We say that these substances are soluble in water.
pwnPigO4MuM--63,What will happen if we go on adding more and more of these substances to a fixed quantity of water?
pwnPigO4MuM--64,Activity 8
pwnPigO4MuM--65," You will need a beaker or a small pan, a spoon, salt and water."
pwnPigO4MuM--66,pour half a cup of water in the beaker
pwnPigO4MuM--67,Add 1 tsp of salt and stir it well until the salt dissolves completely.
pwnPigO4MuM--68,Figure 5.14
pwnPigO4MuM--69,Again add a teaspoonful of salt and salt.
pwnPigO4MuM--71," Go on adding salt, one teaspoonful at a time and stir."
pwnPigO4MuM--72," After adding a few spoons of salt, do you find that some salt remains undisolved and settles at the bottom of the beaker?"
pwnPigO4MuM--73," If yes, this means that no more salt can be dissolved in the amount of water we have taken."
pwnPigO4MuM--74,The solution is now set to be saturated.
pwnPigO4MuM--75,Here is a hint as to what might have gone wrong when Paheli tried to recover large quantity of salt mixed with sand.
pwnPigO4MuM--76,Perhaps the quantity of salt was much more than that required to form a saturated solution.
pwnPigO4MuM--77,The undisolved salt would have remained mixed with the sand and could not be recovered.
pwnPigO4MuM--78,She could solve her problem by using a larger quantity of water.
pwnPigO4MuM--79,Suppose she did not have sufficient quantity of water to dissolve all the salt in the mixture.
pwnPigO4MuM--81,Is there some way that water could be made to dissolve more salt before the solution gets saturated?
pwnPigO4MuM--82,Let us try and help Paheli out.
pwnPigO4MuM--83,Figure 5.14 shows
pwnPigO4MuM--84,Dissolving salt in water
pwnPigO4MuM--85,Activity 9. Take some water in a beaker and mix salt in it until it cannot dissolve any more salt.
pwnPigO4MuM--86,This will give you a saturated solution of salt in water.
pwnPigO4MuM--88,Now add a small quantity of salt to this saturated solution and heat it. What do you find?
pwnPigO4MuM--89,What happens to the undeserved salt in the bottom of the beaker? Does it dissolve now?
pwnPigO4MuM--90," If yes, can some more salt be dissolved in this solution by heating it?"
pwnPigO4MuM--92,Let this hot solution cool. Does the salt appear to settle at the bottom of the beaker again?
pwnPigO4MuM--93,The activity suggests that larger quantity of salt can be dissolved in water on heating.
pwnPigO4MuM--95,Page 43
pwnPigO4MuM--96,Does water dissolve equal amounts of different soluble substances? Let us find out.
pwnPigO4MuM--97,Activity 10
pwnPigO4MuM--98,Take 2 glasses and pour half a cup of water in each of them.
pwnPigO4MuM--99,Add a teaspoon of salt to 1 glass and stir till the salt dissolves. Go on adding salt. One teaspoon at a time till the solution saturates.
pwnPigO4MuM--101,Record the number of spoons of salt that dissolved in the water.
pwnPigO4MuM--102,In table 5.2
pwnPigO4MuM--103,Now repeat the same activity with sugar.
pwnPigO4MuM--104,Repeat this with some other substances that are soluble in water.
pwnPigO4MuM--105,What do you notice from table 5.2?
pwnPigO4MuM--106,Do you find that water dissolves different substances in different amounts?
pwnPigO4MuM--108," Here is table 5.2 given. There are two columns, substance and number of spoons of substance that dissolved in water."
pwnPigO4MuM--110,Substances are salt and sugar. Complete this table by doing this activity yourself.
pwnPigO4MuM--112,We have discussed a few methods of separating substances.
pwnPigO4MuM--113,Some of the methods of separation presented in this chapter are also used in a science laboratory.
pwnPigO4MuM--114,We also learnt that a solution is prepared by dissolving a substance in a liquid.
pwnPigO4MuM--116,A solution is said to be saturated if it cannot dissolve more of the substance in it.

cjvBVQ8zgPU--1,Game
cjvBVQ8zgPU--3,Who colors the circle first?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--4,This game is to be played in groups of 4.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--5,Each player has to make a circle as shown.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--6,Each one has to make 15 tokens on slips of paper. Write
cjvBVQ8zgPU--7,1 by 2
cjvBVQ8zgPU--8,1 by 3
cjvBVQ8zgPU--9,1 by 4
cjvBVQ8zgPU--10,1 by 6

cjvBVQ8zgPU--14,4 by 12 etc
cjvBVQ8zgPU--15,till 11 by 12
cjvBVQ8zgPU--16,to make your tokens.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--17,Shuffle the tokens and make a pile in the middle of the group. Now you are ready to
cjvBVQ8zgPU--18,start the game!
cjvBVQ8zgPU--19,The first player takes a token from the pile.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--20,Colors that part of the picture and put the token under the pile.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--21,The next player does the same and so on.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--22,The winner is the one who first colors the circle completely.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--23,Who won the game?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--24,What are the winner's tokens?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--26,Write the tokens you got.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--27,What part of the circle did you color?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--28,Next to this we have the picture of a circle. The card puzzle.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--30,Look carefully at the picture and get ready to answer four questions.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--31," Below this we have the picture of four different squares, A, B, C and D."
cjvBVQ8zgPU--32," Squares A, B and C have a small black square at their different corners."
cjvBVQ8zgPU--34,Square D is completely empty.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--35,Page 61.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--36,divide the white area in square A
cjvBVQ8zgPU--37,into 2 equal parts.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--38,Got the answer?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--39,Was that easy? Now do the second question.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--40,2
cjvBVQ8zgPU--41,divide the white area in square b into 3 equal parts.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--42," That too is easy, isn't it?"
cjvBVQ8zgPU--43," Now see the third question, 3."
cjvBVQ8zgPU--44,Divide the white area in square C into 4 equal parts. Is it a bit difficult?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--45," Don't worry, take your time."
cjvBVQ8zgPU--46," Only if you have given up, look for the answer."
cjvBVQ8zgPU--47,Here comes the last question. 4.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--48,divide the white area in square D into seven equal parts.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--49,The world record for this is 7 seconds.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--50,but you can take minutes.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--51,Tired of thinking?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--52,Look for the answer on page 68. So.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--53, Was that difficult? Guess and
cjvBVQ8zgPU--54,check. Hey.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--55,What part of each shape is coloured?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--56,Below this we have two different pictures with two different shapes.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--57,The first one is a white octagon.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--58,which has a blue triangle drawn on it.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--59,The second one is a white rectangle with a magenta square on one of the corners.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--60,for the teacher.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--61,The colouring circle game and many more such activities should be done in class.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--62,the follow-up discussions for all these activities.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--63,will play a major role in developing children's conceptual understanding about fractions.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--65,page 62. 3.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--66,There's a white square in which we see two red small squares.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--67,one on the top and one on the bottom right corner. four
cjvBVQ8zgPU--68,There's a white rectangle.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--69," lying horizontally, in which we see..."
cjvBVQ8zgPU--70,four different magenta squares.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--71,B
cjvBVQ8zgPU--72,We see the picture of a big square.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--73,which is divided by different lines into different shapes.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--74,Do you remember this picture?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--75,Look at the small triangle. What?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--76,part of the square is it? How will you find this out?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--78," divide the big triangles and other shapes into small triangles, like the red one."
cjvBVQ8zgPU--80,How many small triangles are there altogether?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--81,colored parts.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--82,Complete these.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--83,We see four different circles here.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--84,Each with different shapes and colors drawn inside it with the help of some lines.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--85,Below the circles we have the text written.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--86,1
cjvBVQ8zgPU--87,This circle is divided into two equal parts.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--88," out of, dash, equal parts."
cjvBVQ8zgPU--89,One part is coloured blue. Two
cjvBVQ8zgPU--90,Here the circle is divided into...
cjvBVQ8zgPU--91,dash equal parts out of
cjvBVQ8zgPU--92,dash equal parts.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--93,dash parts are coloured blue.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--94,3. Here the circle is.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--95,dash
cjvBVQ8zgPU--96,4. Here the circle is 
cjvBVQ8zgPU--97,dash. So we can say that
cjvBVQ8zgPU--98,1 by 2 is equal to 2 by dash.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--99,is equal to dash
cjvBVQ8zgPU--100,by 6 is equal to...
cjvBVQ8zgPU--101,dash by 8.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--102,page 63.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--103,Cutting the halwa.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--104," On top of the page we see the picture of a man who has brought some halva for his two kids, Ammu and Anu."
cjvBVQ8zgPU--105,The two girls who seem very happy.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--106," Ramesh bought a piece of halva for his children, Ammu and Anu."
cjvBVQ8zgPU--107,he divided it equally for them.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--108,each will get dash part of halva.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--109," This piece is too big. We can't eat it, they said."
cjvBVQ8zgPU--110,So he divided the pieces into half again.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--112,Now how many pieces will Ammu get?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--113,What part of the halva is it?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--114,dash
cjvBVQ8zgPU--115," Make it even smaller, Dad."
cjvBVQ8zgPU--116,They asked.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--117,So he again cut the halva into smaller pieces.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--119," Okay, thank you, dad."
cjvBVQ8zgPU--120,page 64.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--121,Now how many pieces will each get?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--122,What part of the halva is each piece now?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--123," If Ramesh had cut the halva into six equal parts, how many pieces would each have got?"
cjvBVQ8zgPU--124,Look at your answers for questions 1 to 4.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--125,and write.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--126,1 by 2 is equal to dash.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--127,by dash is equal to dash by dash.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--128,is equal to dash by dash is equal to
cjvBVQ8zgPU--129,dash by dash is equal to
cjvBVQ8zgPU--130,dash by dash. parts of the scrape.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--132,look at the picture.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--133,Write what part of the strip is each green piece.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--134,Write the part for a piece of each color.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--135,Below this we see a big rectangle.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--136,with many different coloured strips inside it.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--137,How many one-fourths will make a half?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--138,How many one-eighth will make a one fourth
cjvBVQ8zgPU--139,How many one eight are in half?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--140,Now ask your friends some questions on the same picture. Patterns
cjvBVQ8zgPU--141,There's a picture of a square.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--142," which is divided into different parts through some lines, creating some rectangles and squares of different colors and sizes."
cjvBVQ8zgPU--143,look at the square.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--144,What part is coloured blue?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--145,What part is green? Puzzle
cjvBVQ8zgPU--146,Is it equal
cjvBVQ8zgPU--147,Ammini says half of half and one third of three-quarters are equal.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--148,Do you agree?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--149,How will you show this?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--150,for the teacher.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--151," The use of concrete things such as match sticks, bottle caps etc will help children make sense of equivalent fractions such as"
cjvBVQ8zgPU--153,1 by 2 is equal to 2 by 4.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--154,is equal to 3 by 6.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--155,is equal to 4 by 8.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--156,is equal to 5 by 10.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--157,Children must make their own fraction strips using papers of different sizes.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--158,Encourage them to compare the strips by coloring them into different fractions.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--159,page 65. From a part
cjvBVQ8zgPU--160,to the whole. We see the picture of a
cjvBVQ8zgPU--161,part of a flower.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--162,1. This shows
cjvBVQ8zgPU--163,one fifth petals of a flower.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--164,Complete the flower by drawing the other petals.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--165," 2. Again, here is a picture."
cjvBVQ8zgPU--166,The picture shows want her of the blades of a fan.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--168,Complete the picture by drawing the other blades.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--169,3
cjvBVQ8zgPU--170,Half of the blades of another fan are shown here.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--171,Complete the picture by drawing the other half.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--172,How many blades have you drawn?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--173,Rupees and Paise
cjvBVQ8zgPU--174,How many 50 paise will make 1 rupee?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--175,Is 50 paise half of 1 rupee?
cjvBVQ8zgPU--176,How many 25-paise coins will make one rupee? 25-paise is
cjvBVQ8zgPU--177,Dash part of one rupee.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--178,20 paise is dash
cjvBVQ8zgPU--179,part of one rupee.
cjvBVQ8zgPU--180,How many 10 paises will make one rupee? So
cjvBVQ8zgPU--181,10 paise is dash part of one rupee.

HBQwzyxvkZA--9,Paheli & Boojho went on vacation.
HBQwzyxvkZA--10,to many places of interest.
HBQwzyxvkZA--11,One such strip took them to the river Ganga in Rishikesh.
HBQwzyxvkZA--12," They climbed the mountains of the Himalayas, where it was very cold."
HBQwzyxvkZA--13,They saw many kinds of trees on these mountains.
HBQwzyxvkZA--14,"Oaks, Pines and Deodars"
HBQwzyxvkZA--15,Very different from the ones near their home on the plains. In yet another trip.
HBQwzyxvkZA--16,They travelled to Rajasthan.
HBQwzyxvkZA--17,and moved on camels through the hot desert.
HBQwzyxvkZA--18,They collected different kinds of cactus plants from this strip.
HBQwzyxvkZA--19," Finally, they went on a trip to Puri."
HBQwzyxvkZA--20," and visited the seabeach, dotted with"
HBQwzyxvkZA--21,casuarina trees
HBQwzyxvkZA--22,while recollecting all the fun that they had on these strips.
HBQwzyxvkZA--23,A thought struck them.
HBQwzyxvkZA--24,All these places were so different from one another.
HBQwzyxvkZA--25," Some very cold, some very hot and dry."
HBQwzyxvkZA--26,and some places so humid.
HBQwzyxvkZA--27,and yet all of them had many organisms.
HBQwzyxvkZA--28,living creatures of various kinds.
HBQwzyxvkZA--29,They tried to think of a place on Earth.
HBQwzyxvkZA--30,where there may not be any living creatures.
HBQwzyxvkZA--31,Boojho thought of places near his home
HBQwzyxvkZA--32," Inside the house, he tried the cupboards."
HBQwzyxvkZA--33,He had thought that there may not be any living organisms here.
HBQwzyxvkZA--34,But he found one tiny spider in the cupboard.
HBQwzyxvkZA--35," Outside the home too, there did not seem to be any place he could think of that did not have living creatures."
HBQwzyxvkZA--36,of some kind or the other. Figure 9.1.
HBQwzyxvkZA--37,Paheli started thinking and reading about far away places.
HBQwzyxvkZA--38,She read that people have even found tiny living organisms in the openings of volcanoes.
HBQwzyxvkZA--39,Figure 9.1 shows search for living organisms.
HBQwzyxvkZA--40," 9.1, organisms and the surroundings where they live."
HBQwzyxvkZA--41,Another thought that occurred to Paheli and Boojho was about the kinds of living organisms.
HBQwzyxvkZA--42,that were present in different locations that they had visited.
HBQwzyxvkZA--43,The deserts had camels
HBQwzyxvkZA--44,The mountains had goats and yaks.
HBQwzyxvkZA--45,Puri had some other creatures.
HBQwzyxvkZA--46,Crabs on the beach and such a variety of fish being caught by the fishermen at the sea. And then...
HBQwzyxvkZA--47,There did seem to be some creatures like ants.
HBQwzyxvkZA--48,that were present in all these different locations.
HBQwzyxvkZA--49,The kinds of plants found in each of these regions were so different from the plants of the other regions.
HBQwzyxvkZA--50,What about the surroundings in these different regions?
HBQwzyxvkZA--51,Were they the same?
HBQwzyxvkZA--52,page 80 Activity 1
HBQwzyxvkZA--53,Let us start with the forest.
HBQwzyxvkZA--54," Think of all the plants, animals and objects that can be found there."
HBQwzyxvkZA--55,List them in column 1 of table 9.1.
HBQwzyxvkZA--56," List things, animals and plants found in the other regions that are also shown in the table."
HBQwzyxvkZA--57,You can collect the examples scattered through this chapter to fill table 9.1.
HBQwzyxvkZA--58," Discuss also with your friends, parents and teachers."
HBQwzyxvkZA--59,to find more examples to fill the tables.
HBQwzyxvkZA--60,You can also consult many interesting books in libraries.
HBQwzyxvkZA--61," that talk of animals, plants and minerals of different regions."
HBQwzyxvkZA--62," Try and include many plants, animals and objects big and small in each of the columns in this table."
HBQwzyxvkZA--63,What kind of objects will we find that may not be animals or plants?
HBQwzyxvkZA--64,Perhaps parts of plants like dried leaves or parts of animals like bones.
HBQwzyxvkZA--65,We may also find different kinds of soils and pebbles.
HBQwzyxvkZA--66,Water in the oceans may have salts dissolved in it as discussed in Chapter 5.
HBQwzyxvkZA--67,There could be many more objects.
HBQwzyxvkZA--68," As we go through the chapter, keep adding more examples to table 9.1."
HBQwzyxvkZA--69,We will discuss the table as we travel through many more interesting places. Table 9.1
HBQwzyxvkZA--70," Animals, plants and the other objects found in different surroundings."
HBQwzyxvkZA--71,The table is divided into 5 columns.
HBQwzyxvkZA--72,in the forest on mountains

HBQwzyxvkZA--74,Complete this table according to your observation. 9.2
HBQwzyxvkZA--75,Habitat and Adaptation
HBQwzyxvkZA--76,What do you find from the plants and animals listed in Activity 1?
HBQwzyxvkZA--77,Did you find a large variety in them?
HBQwzyxvkZA--78,Look at what you have entered in the column for the desert and the column for the sea in table 9.1.
HBQwzyxvkZA--79,Did you list very different kind of organisms in these two columns? What are the surroundings like?
HBQwzyxvkZA--80,in these two regions.
HBQwzyxvkZA--81," In the sea, plants and animals are surrounded by saline."
HBQwzyxvkZA--82,Salty water. Most of them use the air dissolved in water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--83,There is very little water available in the desert. It is very hot.
HBQwzyxvkZA--84,in the daytime and very cold at night in the desert.
HBQwzyxvkZA--85,The animals and plants of the desert live on the desert soil and breathe air from the surroundings.
HBQwzyxvkZA--86,The sea and the desert are very different surroundings. And we find...
HBQwzyxvkZA--87," Very different kind of plants and animals in these two regions, isn't it?"
HBQwzyxvkZA--88,Let us look at two very different kind of organisms from the desert and the sea.
HBQwzyxvkZA--89,a camel and a fish.
HBQwzyxvkZA--90,The body structure of a camel helps it to survive in desert conditions.
HBQwzyxvkZA--91,camels have long legs.
HBQwzyxvkZA--92,which help to keep their bodies away from the heat of the sand.
HBQwzyxvkZA--93,Figure 9.2 Page 81.
HBQwzyxvkZA--94,They excrete small amount of urine. Their tongue is dry.
HBQwzyxvkZA--95,and they do not sweat.
HBQwzyxvkZA--96,Since camels lose very little water from their bodies
HBQwzyxvkZA--97,They can live for many days without water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--98,Let us look at different kinds of fish.
HBQwzyxvkZA--99,Some of these are shown in figure 9.3.
HBQwzyxvkZA--100,There are so many kinds of fish. But...
HBQwzyxvkZA--101,Do you see that they all have something common about their shape? All the ones shown here...
HBQwzyxvkZA--102,Have the streamlined shape that was discussed?
HBQwzyxvkZA--103,in chapter 8. This shape
HBQwzyxvkZA--104,helps them move inside water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--105,Fish have slippery scales on their bodies.
HBQwzyxvkZA--106,These scales protect the fish and also help in easy movement through water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--107,We discussed in chapter 8.
HBQwzyxvkZA--108,That fish have flat fins and tails.
HBQwzyxvkZA--109,that help them to change directions.
HBQwzyxvkZA--110,and keep their body balanced in water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--111,Gills present in the fish help them to use oxygen dissolved in water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--112,We see that the features of a fish help it to live inside water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--113,and the features of a camel help it
HBQwzyxvkZA--114,to survive in a desert.
HBQwzyxvkZA--115,We have taken only two examples from a very wide variety of animals and plants that live on the earth.
HBQwzyxvkZA--116," In all these variety of organisms, we will find that..."
HBQwzyxvkZA--117,They have certain features that help them live in the surroundings.
HBQwzyxvkZA--118,in which they are normally found.
HBQwzyxvkZA--119,The presence of specific features or certain habits
HBQwzyxvkZA--120,which enable an organism to live naturally in a place.
HBQwzyxvkZA--121,is called Adaptation.
HBQwzyxvkZA--122,Adaptation of organisms differ depending on their place of dwelling.
HBQwzyxvkZA--123,That is why a fish cannot live out of water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--124,and a camel cannot live in sea.
HBQwzyxvkZA--125,The place where organisms live is called Habitat.
HBQwzyxvkZA--126,Habitat means a dwelling place or a home.
HBQwzyxvkZA--127," The habitat provides food, water, air, shelter and other needs to organisms."
HBQwzyxvkZA--128,Several kinds of plants and animals live in the same habitat.
HBQwzyxvkZA--129,Plants and animals that live on land are said to live in terrestrial habitats.
HBQwzyxvkZA--130,Some examples of terrestrial habitats are Forests
HBQwzyxvkZA--131,grasslands deserts
HBQwzyxvkZA--132,coastal and mountain regions.
HBQwzyxvkZA--133,Habitats of plants and animals
HBQwzyxvkZA--134,that live in water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--135,are called aquatic habitats.
HBQwzyxvkZA--136,Figure 9.2 shows camels in their surroundings.
HBQwzyxvkZA--137,Figure 9.3 shows different kinds of fish. Page 82.
HBQwzyxvkZA--138," Lakes, rivers and oceans are some examples of aquatic habitats."
HBQwzyxvkZA--139,There are lot variations among terrestrial habitats.
HBQwzyxvkZA--140,like forests.
HBQwzyxvkZA--141," Grasslands, deserts"
HBQwzyxvkZA--142,coastal and mountain regions.
HBQwzyxvkZA--143,located in different parts of the world.
HBQwzyxvkZA--144,There are some changes that can happen in an organism.
HBQwzyxvkZA--145," over a short period of time to help them adjust to some changes in their surroundings. For instance,"
HBQwzyxvkZA--146,If we live in the plains and suddenly go to high mountain regions
HBQwzyxvkZA--147,We may experience difficulty in breathing and doing physical exercise for some days.
HBQwzyxvkZA--148,We need to breathe faster when we are on high mountains.
HBQwzyxvkZA--149,after some days our body adjusts.
HBQwzyxvkZA--150,to the changed conditions on the high mountain.
HBQwzyxvkZA--151,Such small changes that take place in the body of a single organism over short periods.
HBQwzyxvkZA--152,to overcome small problems due to changes in the surroundings.
HBQwzyxvkZA--153,are called acclimatisation
HBQwzyxvkZA--154,These changes are different from the adaptations that take place over thousands of years.
HBQwzyxvkZA--155," The organisms, both plants and animals living in a habitat are its biotic components."
HBQwzyxvkZA--156," The non-living things such as rocks, soil, air and water in the habitat constitute its abiotic components."
HBQwzyxvkZA--157," Are sunlight and heat, biotic or a-biotic components?"
HBQwzyxvkZA--158,We know that some plants grow from seeds. Let us look at some abiotic factors and their effect on seeds as they grow into young plants. Activity 2
HBQwzyxvkZA--159,Recall Activity 5 in Chapter 1.
HBQwzyxvkZA--160,We made sprouts from moong and chana seeds. When the seed...
HBQwzyxvkZA--161," Turned into a sprout, it is said to have germinated."
HBQwzyxvkZA--162,This is the beginning of life of a new plant.
HBQwzyxvkZA--163,Collect some dry moong seeds.
HBQwzyxvkZA--164,Keep 20-30 seeds aside.
HBQwzyxvkZA--165,and soak the rest in water for a day.
HBQwzyxvkZA--166,Divide the soaked seats into 4 parts.
HBQwzyxvkZA--167,Keep one part completely submerged in water for 3-4 days.
HBQwzyxvkZA--168,Do not disturb the dry seeds and those submerged in water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--169,Keep one part of soaked seeds in a sunny room.
HBQwzyxvkZA--170,and another in a completely dark region like a cupboard that does not allow any light to come in.
HBQwzyxvkZA--171,Keep the last part in very cold surroundings.
HBQwzyxvkZA--172,Say in a refrigerator or with ice around them.
HBQwzyxvkZA--173,rinse them and replace the water every day.
HBQwzyxvkZA--174,What do you notice after a few days?
HBQwzyxvkZA--175,Do the seeds in all the five conditions germinate uniformly?
HBQwzyxvkZA--176,Do you find slower or no germination in any of these?
HBQwzyxvkZA--177," Do you realize that abiotic factors like air, water, light and heat?"
HBQwzyxvkZA--178," are important for the growth of plants. In fact,"
HBQwzyxvkZA--179,abiotic factors are important for all living organisms.
HBQwzyxvkZA--180,We find that organisms exist in very cold.
HBQwzyxvkZA--181,as well as very hot climates. Isn't it?
HBQwzyxvkZA--182,How do they manage to survive?
HBQwzyxvkZA--183,Adaptation is the method by which organisms get well adjusted to the climate. Page 83
HBQwzyxvkZA--184,Adaptation does not take place in a short time
HBQwzyxvkZA--185,because the abiotic factors of a region
HBQwzyxvkZA--186,also change very slowly.
HBQwzyxvkZA--187,Those organisms which cannot adapt to these changes die.
HBQwzyxvkZA--188,and only the adapted ones survive. Organisms Adapt.
HBQwzyxvkZA--189,to different abiotic factors in different ways.
HBQwzyxvkZA--190,This results in a wide variety of organisms in different habitats.
HBQwzyxvkZA--191,Let us look at some habitats.
HBQwzyxvkZA--192,understood the a biotic factors and the adaptations of animals in these habitats. 9.3
HBQwzyxvkZA--193,a journey through different habitats.
HBQwzyxvkZA--194,Some terrestrial habitats.
HBQwzyxvkZA--195,Deserts
HBQwzyxvkZA--196,We discussed the aibiotic factors of a desert.
HBQwzyxvkZA--197,and the adaptations in camels.
HBQwzyxvkZA--198,What about other animals and plants that are found in deserts?
HBQwzyxvkZA--199,Do they have the same kind of adaptations?
HBQwzyxvkZA--200,There are desert
HBQwzyxvkZA--201,animals like rats and snakes.
HBQwzyxvkZA--202,which do not have long legs that a camel has.
HBQwzyxvkZA--203,to stay away from the intense heat during the day.
HBQwzyxvkZA--204," They stay in burrows Deep in the Sand, Figure 9.4."
HBQwzyxvkZA--205,These animals come out only during the night when it is cooler.
HBQwzyxvkZA--206,Figure 9.5 shows
HBQwzyxvkZA--207,some typical plants that grow in a desert
HBQwzyxvkZA--208,How are these adapted to the desert? Activity 3
HBQwzyxvkZA--209,Bring a potted cactus and a leafy plant to the classroom.
HBQwzyxvkZA--210,Tie polythene bags to some parts of the two plants as was done for activity 4 in chapter 7. Where we studied.
HBQwzyxvkZA--211,Transpiration in plants.
HBQwzyxvkZA--212,Leave the potted plants in the sun and observe after a few hours. What do you see?
HBQwzyxvkZA--213,Do you notice any difference in the amount of water collected in the two polythene bags?
HBQwzyxvkZA--214,Desert plants lose very little water through transpiration.
HBQwzyxvkZA--215,The leaves in desert plants are either absent.
HBQwzyxvkZA--216,Very small or they are in the form of spines.
HBQwzyxvkZA--217,This helps in reducing loss of water from the leaves through transpiration.
HBQwzyxvkZA--218," The leaf-like structure you see in a cactus is, in fact, its stem."
HBQwzyxvkZA--219,figure 9.5
HBQwzyxvkZA--220,Photosynthesis in these plants is usually carried out by the stems.
HBQwzyxvkZA--221,The stem is also covered with a thick waxy layer.
HBQwzyxvkZA--222,which helps to retain water in the tissues of cacti.
HBQwzyxvkZA--223,Most desert plants have roots that go very deep into the soil for absorbing water. Figure 9.5.
HBQwzyxvkZA--224,some typical plants that grow in desert.
HBQwzyxvkZA--225,page 84.
HBQwzyxvkZA--226,Mountain Regions
HBQwzyxvkZA--227,These habitats are normally very cold and windy. In some areas...
HBQwzyxvkZA--228,snowfall may take place in winters
HBQwzyxvkZA--229,There is a large variety of plants and animals living in the mountain regions.
HBQwzyxvkZA--230,Have you seen the kind of trees shown in figure 9.6?
HBQwzyxvkZA--231," If you live in a mountain region or have visited one, you may have seen a large number of such trees."
HBQwzyxvkZA--232,But have you ever noticed?
HBQwzyxvkZA--233,Such trees naturally growing in other regions.
HBQwzyxvkZA--234,How are these trees adapted to the conditions prevailing in their habitat?
HBQwzyxvkZA--235,These trees are normally cone shaped and have sloping branches.
HBQwzyxvkZA--236,The leaves of some of these trees are needle-like.
HBQwzyxvkZA--237,This helps the rainwater and snow to slide off easily.
HBQwzyxvkZA--238,There could be trees with shapes very different.
HBQwzyxvkZA--239,from these that are
HBQwzyxvkZA--240,also present on mountains.
HBQwzyxvkZA--241,They may have different kind of adaptations to survive on the mountains.
HBQwzyxvkZA--242,Figure 9.6 shows.
HBQwzyxvkZA--243,Trees of a mountain habitat.
HBQwzyxvkZA--244,Animals living in the mountain regions are also adapted to the conditions there.
HBQwzyxvkZA--245,Figure 9.7. They have thick skin or fur.
HBQwzyxvkZA--246,to protect them from cold.
HBQwzyxvkZA--247," For example, yaks have long hair."
HBQwzyxvkZA--248,to keep them warm. Snow leopard has thick fur on its body.
HBQwzyxvkZA--249,Figure 9.7 A shows
HBQwzyxvkZA--250,snow leopard b shows
HBQwzyxvkZA--251,yak and c shows
HBQwzyxvkZA--252,Mountain goat are adapted to mountain habitats.
HBQwzyxvkZA--253,Snow leopard has thick fur on its body.
HBQwzyxvkZA--254,including feet and toes.
HBQwzyxvkZA--255,This protects its feet from the cold.
HBQwzyxvkZA--256,when it walks on the snow. page 85
HBQwzyxvkZA--257,The mountain goat has strong hooves for running up the rocky slopes of the mountains.
HBQwzyxvkZA--258," As we go up in the mountainous regions,"
HBQwzyxvkZA--259,The surroundings change and we see different kinds of adaptations.
HBQwzyxvkZA--260,at different heights. Grasslands
HBQwzyxvkZA--261,A lion lives in a forest or a grassland.
HBQwzyxvkZA--262,and is a strong animal that can hunt and kill animals like deer.
HBQwzyxvkZA--263,It is light brown in colour.
HBQwzyxvkZA--264,Look at the picture of a lion and that of a deer. Figure 9.8.
HBQwzyxvkZA--265,How are the eyes placed in the face for these two animals? Are they in the front?
HBQwzyxvkZA--266,or on the side of the face.
HBQwzyxvkZA--267,Lions have long claws in their front legs that can be withdrawn inside the toes.
HBQwzyxvkZA--268,Do the features of a lion help it in any way to survive?
HBQwzyxvkZA--269,Its light brown color helps it to hide in dry grasslands when it hunts for prey.
HBQwzyxvkZA--270,That is animals to eat.
HBQwzyxvkZA--271,The eyes in front of the face allow it to have a correct idea about the location of its prey.
HBQwzyxvkZA--272,A deer is another animal that lives in forests and grasslands.
HBQwzyxvkZA--273,It has strong teeth for chewing hard plant stems of the forest.
HBQwzyxvkZA--274,A deer needs to know about the presence of predators.
HBQwzyxvkZA--275,That is animals like lion that make it their prey.
HBQwzyxvkZA--276,in order to run away from them and not become their prey.
HBQwzyxvkZA--277,It has long ears to hear movements of predators.
HBQwzyxvkZA--278,The eyes on the side of its head allow it to look in all directions for danger.
HBQwzyxvkZA--279,The speed of the deer helps them to run away from the predators.
HBQwzyxvkZA--280,There are many other features of a lion.
HBQwzyxvkZA--281,a deer or other animals and plants that help them to survive in their habitat.
HBQwzyxvkZA--282,Figure 9.8 A shows a lion and B shows a deer.
HBQwzyxvkZA--283,Some aquatic habitats
HBQwzyxvkZA--284,Oceans
HBQwzyxvkZA--285,We already discussed how fish are adapted to live in the sea. Many other sea animals have.
HBQwzyxvkZA--286,Stream-lined bodies to help them move easily in water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--287,There are some sea animals like squids and octopus which do not have this streamlined shape.
HBQwzyxvkZA--288,They stay deeper in the ocean near the sea bed and catch any prey that moves towards them.
HBQwzyxvkZA--289," However, when they move in water, they make their body shapes streamlined."
HBQwzyxvkZA--290,These animals have gills to help them use oxygen dissolved in water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--291,There are some sea animals like dolphins and whales that do not have gills.
HBQwzyxvkZA--292,page 86.
HBQwzyxvkZA--293,They breathe in air through nostrils or blowholes that are located on the upper parts of their heads.
HBQwzyxvkZA--294,This allows them to breathe in air when they swim near the surface of water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--295,They can stay inside the water for a long time without breathing.
HBQwzyxvkZA--296,They come out to the surface from time to time to breathe in air.
HBQwzyxvkZA--297,Did you ever see this interesting activity of Dolphins' in television program or films on Ocean Life?
HBQwzyxvkZA--298,Ponds and Lakes
HBQwzyxvkZA--299,Have you seen plants growing in ponds?
HBQwzyxvkZA--300," Lakes, rivers and even some drains."
HBQwzyxvkZA--301,Go on a field trip to a nearby pond if possible.
HBQwzyxvkZA--302,and try to observe the kinds of plants that are seen there.
HBQwzyxvkZA--303," Observe the leaves, stems and roots of these plants."
HBQwzyxvkZA--304,Some of these plants have their roots fixed in the soil below the water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--305,Figure 9.9 In terrestrial Plants
HBQwzyxvkZA--306,Roots normally play a very important role in the absorption of nutrients and water from the soil.
HBQwzyxvkZA--307," However, in aquatic plants,"
HBQwzyxvkZA--308,Roots are much reduced in size.
HBQwzyxvkZA--309,And their main function is to hold the plant in place.
HBQwzyxvkZA--310," The stems of these plants are long, hollow and light."
HBQwzyxvkZA--311,The stems grow up to the surface of water while the leaves and flowers
HBQwzyxvkZA--312,Float on the surface of water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--313,Some aquatic plants are submerged in water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--314,All parts of such plants are underwater.
HBQwzyxvkZA--315,Some of these plants have narrow and thin ribbon-like leaves.
HBQwzyxvkZA--316,These can bend in the flowing water. in some
HBQwzyxvkZA--317,submerged plants leaves are often highly divided.
HBQwzyxvkZA--318,through which the water can easily flow
HBQwzyxvkZA--319,without damaging them.
HBQwzyxvkZA--320,Frogs usually live in ponds.
HBQwzyxvkZA--321,Frogs can stay both inside the water as well as move on land.
HBQwzyxvkZA--322,They have strong back legs that help them in leaping and catching their prey.
HBQwzyxvkZA--323,They have webbed feet which help them swim in water.
HBQwzyxvkZA--324,We have discussed only a few common animals and plants compared.
HBQwzyxvkZA--325,to the wide variety that live in different habitats.
HBQwzyxvkZA--326,You may have also noticed the very white variety in plants around you.
HBQwzyxvkZA--327,when you prepared a herbarium as part of the suggested activities.
HBQwzyxvkZA--328,In Chapter 7. Imagine the kind of variety
HBQwzyxvkZA--329,that you could see in a herbarium of leaves of plants from all regions of the earth.
HBQwzyxvkZA--330,Figure 9.9 shows some aquatic plants float on water. Some have their roots fixed in the soil at the bottom.
HBQwzyxvkZA--331,Some aquatic plants are submerged in water.

R5xjlITOxCY--3,Shaila
R5xjlITOxCY--4,How do we make equal angles?
R5xjlITOxCY--5,Shaila replies
R5xjlITOxCY--6,Let us make an angle tester.
R5xjlITOxCY--7,There is a honey bee on the right side of the page.
R5xjlITOxCY--8,telling the students. You also have an angle
R5xjlITOxCY--9,tester in your geometry box.
R5xjlITOxCY--10,It is called a divider. Cut.
R5xjlITOxCY--11,two strips from a cardboard sheet.
R5xjlITOxCY--12,Fix them with a drawing pin or U-clip.
R5xjlITOxCY--13,such that both the strips can move around easily.
R5xjlITOxCY--14,Rohini and Mohini went all around with the angle tester.
R5xjlITOxCY--15,to look for different angles in their class.
R5xjlITOxCY--16,Rohini tested the angle of the maths book.
R5xjlITOxCY--17,and the pencil box.
R5xjlITOxCY--18," Rohini says, look at the tester."
R5xjlITOxCY--19,It has opened like the letter L.

_EVjLdEmSOA--19,Engineers stumbled upon the site of Harappa in present-day Pakistan.
_EVjLdEmSOA--20," To them, it seemed like a mound."
_EVjLdEmSOA--21,that was a rich source of ready-made high quality bricks.
_EVjLdEmSOA--22,So they carried off thousands of bricks from the walls of the old buildings of the city to build railway lines.
_EVjLdEmSOA--23,Many buildings were completely destroyed. 3.
_EVjLdEmSOA--24," 31 years ago, archaeologist found the site."
_EVjLdEmSOA--26,and realized that this was one of the oldest cities in the subcontinent.
_EVjLdEmSOA--27," As this was the first city to be discovered, all other sites from their similar buildings and other things were found were described as Harapan."

_EVjLdEmSOA--34,Many of these cities were divided into two.
_EVjLdEmSOA--35,or more parts. Usually
_EVjLdEmSOA--36,The part to the west was smaller but higher.
_EVjLdEmSOA--37,archaeologists describe this as the citadel.
_EVjLdEmSOA--38," Generally, the part to the east was larger but lower."
_EVjLdEmSOA--39,This is called the lower town. Very often
_EVjLdEmSOA--40,walls of baked Brick were built around
_EVjLdEmSOA--41,each part.
_EVjLdEmSOA--42,The bricks were so well baked that they have lasted for thousands of years.
_EVjLdEmSOA--44,The bricks were laid in an interlocking pattern.

mXq8axygjdE--1,Lesson 1
mXq8axygjdE--2,a tale of two birds.
mXq8axygjdE--4,The synopsis of the first part is
mXq8axygjdE--5,A mother bird and her two young ones lived in a forest.
mXq8axygjdE--6,The mother was killed in a storm and the young birds were separated from each other.
mXq8axygjdE--7,Each found a different home.
mXq8axygjdE--8," Now, listen. There once lives."
mXq8axygjdE--9,a bird and a two newborn babies in a forest.
mXq8axygjdE--11,They had a nest in a tall shady tree. And there the
mXq8axygjdE--12,the mother bird took care of her little ones.
mXq8axygjdE--13,Day and Night
mXq8axygjdE--14," One day, there was a big storm. There was thunder, lightning and rain. And the wind blew down many trees. The toll tree."
mXq8axygjdE--15,in which the birds lived also came down.
mXq8axygjdE--16,A big heavy branch hit the nest.
mXq8axygjdE--17,and kill the bird.
mXq8axygjdE--18," Fortunately, for the baby birds, the strong wind blew them away."
mXq8axygjdE--19,to the other side of the forest.
mXq8axygjdE--21,One of them came down near a cave where a gang of robbers lived.
mXq8axygjdE--23," The other landed outside a Rishis ashram, a little distance away."
mXq8axygjdE--25,Days passed and the baby birds became big birds.
mXq8axygjdE--26," One day, the king of the country came to the forest to hunt."
mXq8axygjdE--28,He saw a deer and rode after it. It ran deep into the forest followed by the king. Soon the king lost his way.
mXq8axygjdE--29,and didn't know where he was.
mXq8axygjdE--30," He rode on for a long time till he came to the other side of the forest. Very tired by now, he got off his horse and sat down under a tree that stood near a cave."
mXq8axygjdE--32," Suddenly, he heard a voice cry out. Quick, hurry up!"
mXq8axygjdE--33,There is someone here under the tree. Come and take his jewels and his horse. Come and take his jewels and his horse.
mXq8axygjdE--34,or else he'll slip away.
mXq8axygjdE--35,The king was amazed. He looked up and saw.
mXq8axygjdE--36,big brown bird on the tree under which he was sitting.
mXq8axygjdE--37,He also heard faint noises.
mXq8axygjdE--38," As soon as he was taken to the cave, he quickly got on to his horse and rode away as fast as he could."
mXq8axygjdE--40,Now the synopsis of the second part of the lesson. The king was amazed to hear a similar voice again.
mXq8axygjdE--41,He came to know the bird's true story.
mXq8axygjdE--43,He met the Rishi who explained the behavior of each bird.
mXq8axygjdE--44,Soon.
mXq8axygjdE--45,He came to a clearing which looked like an ashram. It was the Rishis ashram. The king tied his horse to it.
mXq8axygjdE--46,tree and sat down in its shade.
mXq8axygjdE--47," Suddenly, he heard a gentle voice announce."
mXq8axygjdE--48," Welcome to the Ashram, Sir. Please go inside and rest."
mXq8axygjdE--49,The Rishi will be back soon. There is some cool water in the pot. Please make yourself comfortable.
mXq8axygjdE--51,The king looked up and saw a big brown bird in the tree. He was amazed. This one looks like the other bird outside the cave.
mXq8axygjdE--52," He said to himself aloud, Your right sir answered the bird. He is my brother, but he has made friends with robbers."
mXq8axygjdE--53,He now talks as they do.
mXq8axygjdE--54,He doesn't talk to me anymore.
mXq8axygjdE--55," Just then, the Rishi entered the Ashram."
mXq8axygjdE--56,page number three
mXq8axygjdE--57," Welcome, sir. He said to the king, please come inside and make yourself at home."
mXq8axygjdE--58,You look tired.
mXq8axygjdE--59,Rest for a while.
mXq8axygjdE--60,Then you can share my food.
mXq8axygjdE--61,The King told the Rishi the story of the two birds and how each had behaved so differently though they looked so alike. The Forest.
mXq8axygjdE--62,is full of surprises he said.
mXq8axygjdE--63,the holy man smiled and said.
mXq8axygjdE--64," After all, one is known by the company one keeps."
mXq8axygjdE--65,that bird has always heard the talk of robbers.
mXq8axygjdE--66,He imitates them and talks about robbing people.
mXq8axygjdE--67,This one has repeated that he has always heard.
mXq8axygjdE--68,He welcomes people to the ashram.
mXq8axygjdE--69,Now come inside and rest. I'll tell you more about this place and these birds.
mXq8axygjdE--70,Now the questions.
mXq8axygjdE--71,Question number one.
mXq8axygjdE--72,How did the two baby birds get separated?
mXq8axygjdE--73,Question number two.
mXq8axygjdE--74,Where did each of them find a home?
mXq8axygjdE--75,Question number three.
mXq8axygjdE--76,What did the first bird say to the stranger?
mXq8axygjdE--78,Question number four.
mXq8axygjdE--79,What did the second bird say to him?
mXq8axygjdE--80,Question number five.
mXq8axygjdE--81,how did the Rishi explain the different ways in which the birds behaved?
mXq8axygjdE--82,Question number six.
mXq8axygjdE--83,which one or the following sums up the story best?
mXq8axygjdE--84,1. A bird in hand is worth
mXq8axygjdE--85,3 in the bush. 2
mXq8axygjdE--86,One is known by the company one keeps 3
mXq8axygjdE--87,A friend in need is a friend indeed.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--1,for class 6
Vc-RbJc2Be0--2," Entitled, Science 2"
Vc-RbJc2Be0--3,This is the lesson 15. Title
Vc-RbJc2Be0--4,Air round us.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--5,From page 147 to page 154.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--6,Page 148
Vc-RbJc2Be0--7,We have learnt in chapter 9 that all living things
Vc-RbJc2Be0--8,Required Air
Vc-RbJc2Be0--9,But have you ever seen air?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--10," You might not have seen air, but surely you must have felt its presence in so many ways."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--12,You notice it when the leaves of the trees rustle or the clothes hanging on a clothes line sway?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--13,Pages of an open book begin fluttering when the fan is switched on.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--14,The moving air makes it possible for you to fly your kite.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--15,Do you remember activity 3 in Chapter 5 in which you separated the sand and sawdust by winnowing?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--16,winnowing is more effective in moving air.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--17,You may have noticed that during storms the wind blows at a very high speed.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--18,It may even uproot trees and blow off the rooftops.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--19,Have you ever played with a firki?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--20,Figure 15.2
Vc-RbJc2Be0--21,Here is the figure 15.1 which shows different types of firki.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--22,Activity 2
Vc-RbJc2Be0--23,Let us make a firki of our own.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--24,Following the instructions shown in figure 15.2.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--25,Hold the stake of the firki and place it in different directions in an open area.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--26,Move it a little back and forth.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--27,Observe what happens.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--28,Does the firki root it?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--29,What makes a ferky rotate? Moving air isn't it?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--30,Have you seen a weather cock?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--31," Figure 15.3, it shows the direction in which the air is moving at that place."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--32,15.1
Vc-RbJc2Be0--33,Is air present everywhere around us?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--34,Close your face. What do you have it? Nothing?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--35,Try the following activity to find out.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--36,Activity 3
Vc-RbJc2Be0--37,Take an empty glass bottle.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--38,Is it really empty or does it have something inside?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--39,Turn it upside down. Is something inside it now?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--40,Now dip the open mouth of the bottle into the bucket filled with water.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--41,as shown in figure 15.5
Vc-RbJc2Be0--42,Observe the bottle. Does water enters the bottle.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--43,Now tilt the bottle slightly.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--44,Does the water now enter the bottle?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--45,Do you see bubbles coming out of the bottle or hear any bubbly sound?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--46,Can you now guess what was in the bottle?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--47," Yes, you are right, it is air. That was present in the bottle."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--48,The bottle was not empty at all.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--49," In fact, it was filled completely with air even when you turned it upside down."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--50,That is why you notice that water does not enter the bottle when it is in an inverted position.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--51,As there was no space for air to escape.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--52," When the bottle was still tipped, the"
Vc-RbJc2Be0--53,air was able to come out in the form of bubbles and water filled up the empty space that the air has occupied.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--54,figure 15.4 shows experiments with an empty bottle.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--55,This activity shows that air occupies space.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--56,It fills all the space in the bottle. It is present.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--57,everywhere around us.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--58,Air has no colour and one can see through it. It is transparent.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--59,Our Earth is surrounded by a thin layer of air.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--60,This layer extends up to many kilometers above the surface of the earth and is called atmosphere.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--61,Why do you think mountaineers carry oxygen cylinders with them?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--62," While climbing high mountains, figure 15.5. 15.2."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--63,What is air made up of?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--64," Until the 18th century, people thought that air was just one substance."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--65,Experiments have proved that it is rarely not so. Air is a mixture of many gases.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--66,What kind of a mixture is it?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--67,Let us find out about some of the major components of this mixture one by one.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--68,water vapor
Vc-RbJc2Be0--69,We have learnt earlier that air contains water vapour. We also saw that...
Vc-RbJc2Be0--70," When air comes in contact with a cool surface,"
Vc-RbJc2Be0--71,It condenses and drops of water appear on the cool surfaces.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--72,The presence of water vapor in air is important for the water cycle in nature.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--73,Page 149.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--74,oxygen
Vc-RbJc2Be0--75,Activity 4
Vc-RbJc2Be0--76," In the presence of your teacher, fix two small candles of the same length."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--77,on a table.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--78,Light both the candles.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--79,Cover one of the candles with an inverted glass tumbler.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--80,Observe both the candles carefully. Do both the candles.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--81,Continue to burn or go off.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--83,You must have observed that the candle covered with glass tumbler got extinguished after some time.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--84,Whereas the other candle continued burning. What can be the reason for this?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--85,Think about it.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--86,Figure 15.6 Shows
Vc-RbJc2Be0--87,Air has oxygen.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--88,It seems that the candle got extinguished because the component inside of the glass tumbler which supports burning is limited.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--89," Most of the component is used up by the burning candles. However, the other candle is getting continued supply of air."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--90,This component of air which supports burning is known as oxygen.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--91,Nitrogen
Vc-RbJc2Be0--92,In Activity 4
Vc-RbJc2Be0--93,Did you observe that air is still present in the glass bottle?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--94,Even after the candle blew out.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--95,This indicates the presence of some component.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--96,in the air which does not support burning.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--97,The major part of air which does not support burning candle is nitrogen.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--98,Carbon dioxide
Vc-RbJc2Be0--99," In a closed room, if there is some material that is burning, you may have..."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--100,felt suffocation.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--101,This is due to excess of carbon dioxide that may be accumulating in the room as the burning
Vc-RbJc2Be0--102,continues.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--103,Carbon dioxide makes up a small component of the air around us.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--104,Plants and animals consume oxygen for respiration and produce carbon dioxide. Plants and animals matter
Vc-RbJc2Be0--105,also consumes oxygen on burning and produces mainly carbon dioxide and a few other gases.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--106,It is advisable not to burn dry leaves and discarded remains of the crop.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--107,which pollute our surroundings.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--108,dust and smoke
Vc-RbJc2Be0--109,The burning of fuel also produces smoke.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--110,Thank you.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--111,Smoke contains a few guesses and fine dust particles and is often harmful.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--112,That is why you see long chimneys in factories.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--113,This takes the harmful smoke and gases away from our noses.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--114,But brings it closer to the birds flying up in the sky.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--115,Dust particles are always present in air.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--116,Page 151
Vc-RbJc2Be0--117,Activity 5
Vc-RbJc2Be0--118,Find a sunny room in your school or at home.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--119,Close all the doors and windows with curtains pulled down to make the room dark.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--120,Now open the door or a window facing the sun. Just a little in such a way that it allows sunlight to enter the room only through a slit.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--121,Look carefully at the incoming beam of sunlight.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--123,Do you see some tiny shining particles moving in the beam of sunlight? Figger 15.8
Vc-RbJc2Be0--124,What are these particles?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--125,During winters you might have observed similar beam of sunlight filter through the trees in which dust particles appear to dance merrily around.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--126,This shows that air also contains dust particles.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--127,The presence of dust particles in air varies from time to time and from place to place.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--128,We inhale air when we breathe through our nostrils.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--129,Fine hair and mucus are present inside the nose. To prevent dust particles
Vc-RbJc2Be0--130,from getting into the respiratory system.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--131,Boojho is asking you why do you think the policeman in figure 15.8 is wearing a mask?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--132,Figger 15.7 shows observing presence of dust in air with sunlight.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--133,Figger 15.8 shows policeman regulating traffic at a crowded crossing often wear a mask.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--134,Do you recall being scolded by your parents when you breathe through your mouth?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--135," If you do that, harmful dust particles may enter your body."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--136,We may conclude that
Vc-RbJc2Be0--137," Air contains some gases, water vapor and dust particles."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--138," The gases in air are mainly nitrogen, oxygen, small amount of carbon dioxide and many other gases."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--139," However, there may be some variations in the composition of air from place to place."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--140," Paheli wants to know why the transparent glass of windows, if not wiped off regularly, appears hazy."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--141,But who wants to know why during an incident of fire one is advised to wrap a wollen blanket over a burning object?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--142," Stay light. Think of us as the finale, the end we did. Think the end of this polygon. Think of us as the finale,"
Vc-RbJc2Be0--143,Page 152
Vc-RbJc2Be0--144,We see that air contains mostly nitrogen and oxygen.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--145," In fact, these two gases together make up 99% of the air."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--146,The remaining 1% is constituted by carbon dioxide and a few other gases.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--147,and water vapor.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--148,Figger 15.10
Vc-RbJc2Be0--149,Figure 15.9 shows composition of air.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--150,15.3. How does oxygen become available to animals and plants living in water and soil?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--151,Activity 6
Vc-RbJc2Be0--152,Take some water in a glass or metal container.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--153,Heat it slowly on a tripod stand.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--154," Well, before the water begins to boil..."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--155,Look carefully at the inner surface of the container.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--156,Do you see tiny bubbles on the inside? Let's build
Vc-RbJc2Be0--157,15.10.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--158,These bubbles come from the air dissolved in water.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--159," When you heat the water to begin with, the air dissolved in it escapes."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--160," As you continue heating, the water itself turns into vapor and finally begins to boil."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--161,We learnt in chapters 8 and 9 that the animals living in water use the dissolved oxygen in water.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--162,The organisms that live in soil also need oxygen to respire isn't it?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--163,How do they get the air they need for respiration?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--164,Here is a question from Pahili. Will the tiny air bubbles seen before the water actually boils?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--165,Also appear if we do this activity by re-heating boiled water cap-
Vc-RbJc2Be0--166,in an air tight bottle.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--167," If you do not know the answer, you may try doing it and see for yourself."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--168,Figger 15.10 shows water contains air.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--169,Activity 7
Vc-RbJc2Be0--170," Take a lump of dry soil in a beaker or a glass, add water to it and note what happens."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--171,Fager 15.12
Vc-RbJc2Be0--172,Do you see bubbles coming out from soil? These bubbles indicate the presence of air in the soil.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--173," When the water is poured on the lump of soil, it displaces the air which is seen in the form of bubbles. The earth."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--174,organisms that live inside the soil and the plant roots rest.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--175,in this air.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--176,A lot of burrows and holes are formed in deep soil by the animals living in the soil.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--177,These burrows also make spaces available for air to move in and out of the soil.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--178," However, when it rains heavily, water fills up all the spaces occupied by the air in the soil."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--179," In this situation, animals living in the soil have to come out for respiration."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--180,Could this be the reason why earthworms come out of the soil only during heavy rains?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--181,Have you ever wondered why all the oxygen of atmosphere does not get used up though a large number of organisms are consuming it?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--182,Who is refilling the oxygen in the atmosphere?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--183,Figger 15.11 shows soil has air in it.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--184,15.4 How is the oxygen?
Vc-RbJc2Be0--185,in the atmosphere replaced.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--186," In Chapter 7, we read about photosynthesis. In this process, plants make their own food and oxygen is produced along with it."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--187,plants also consume oxygen for respiration.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--188,But they produce more of it than they consume. That is why we see.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--189,plants produce oxygen.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--190,It is obvious that animals cannot live without plants.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--191,The balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is maintained through respiration in plants and animals and by the photosynthesis in plants.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--192,This shows the interdependence of plants and animals.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--193,We can now appreciate how important air is for life on Earth.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--194,Are there any other uses of air? Have you heard about a windmill? Look at figure 15.13
Vc-RbJc2Be0--195,Figure 15.12 shoes of windmill
Vc-RbJc2Be0--196,The wind makes the windmill rotate.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--197,The windmill is used to draw water from tube wells and to run flower mills.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--198,Windmills are also used to generate electricity.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--199," Air helps in the movements of sailing yachts, gliders, parachutes and aeroplanes."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--201," Birds, bats and insects can fly due to the presence of air."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--202,Air also helps in the dispersal of seeds and pollen of flowers of several plants.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--203,Air please an important role in water cycle.

Vc-RbJc2Be0--216,Air occupies space
Vc-RbJc2Be0--217,Air is present in water and soil.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--218," Air is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapor and a few other gases."
Vc-RbJc2Be0--219,Some dust particles may also be present in it.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--220,Oxygen supports burning and is necessary for living organisms.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--221,The envelope of air that surrounds the Earth is known as atmosphere.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--222,atmosphere is essential for life on Earth.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--223,Aquatic animals use dissolved air in water for respiration.
Vc-RbJc2Be0--224,Plants and animals depend on each other for exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide from air.

6Lb8PCw6vcc--1,For class 6 Entitled Science 1
6Lb8PCw6vcc--2," This is the lesson number 2, title."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--3,components of food
6Lb8PCw6vcc--4,from page 8 to 17. Page 8
6Lb8PCw6vcc--5,components of food.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--6," In Chapter 1, we made lists of the food items that we eat. We also identified food items eaten in different parts of India and marked these on its map."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--7," A meal could consist of chapati, dal and brinjal curry."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--8," Another may be rice, sambar and a vegetable preparation of ladies finger, bhindi."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--9," Yet another meal could be appam, fish curry and vegetables."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--10,Activity 1
6Lb8PCw6vcc--11,Our meals usually have at least one item made of some kind of grain.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--12,Other items could be a dal or a dish of meat and vegetables.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--13," It may also include items like curd, buttermilk and pickles."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--14,Some examples of meals from different
6Lb8PCw6vcc--15,regions are given in table 2.1.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--16,Select food items you depicted on the map in Chapter 1.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--17,Add some more meals to this list and enter these in table 2.1.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--18," Sometimes we may not really have all this variety in our meals. If we are travelling, we may eat whatever is available on the way. It may not be possible for some of us to eat such a variety of items most of the time."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--19," There must be some reason though, why meals usually consist of such a distribution. Do you think that..."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--20,But our body needs different kinds of food for some special purpose.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--21,Table 2.1 Some common meals of different regions or states.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--22," There are five columns are given in this table, region or state."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--23,Item of Grain
6Lb8PCw6vcc--24,Item of Dal or Meat
6Lb8PCw6vcc--25,vegetables
6Lb8PCw6vcc--26,others First is
6Lb8PCw6vcc--27,Region or State Punjab
6Lb8PCw6vcc--28,item of grain - makki
6Lb8PCw6vcc--29,corn roti
6Lb8PCw6vcc--30," item of dal or meat, Rajma, kidney beans, vegetables, sarsosag, mustard leaf curry, others, curd ghee."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--31,"second Region or State Andhra Pradesh, Item of grain, Rice, Item of Daal or Meat"
6Lb8PCw6vcc--32,Tuar dal and Rasam

6Lb8PCw6vcc--34,Kunduru (Dondakai)
6Lb8PCw6vcc--35,others buttermilk ghee pickle
6Lb8PCw6vcc--36,Avakai
6Lb8PCw6vcc--37,Now it's your turn to complete this table. Add some more meals to this list and enter these in this table.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--38,2.1. What do different food items contain?
6Lb8PCw6vcc--39," We know that each dish is usually made up of one or more ingredients, which we get from plants or animals. Page 9"
6Lb8PCw6vcc--40,These ingredients contain some components that are needed by our body. These components are called nutrients.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--41,The major nutrients in our food are named
6Lb8PCw6vcc--42," Carbohydrates, proteins, fats,"
6Lb8PCw6vcc--43,Vitamins and Minerals
6Lb8PCw6vcc--44," In addition, food contains dietary fibers and water."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--45,which are also needed by our body.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--46,Do all foods contain all these nutrients?
6Lb8PCw6vcc--47," With some simple methods, we can test whether cooked food or a raw ingredient contains one or more of these nutrients."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--48," The tests for presence of carbohydrates, proteins and fats are simpler to do as compared to the tests for other nutrients."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--49,Let us do these tests and record all our observations in table 2.2.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--50," For carrying out these tests, you will need solutions of iodine, copper sulfate and caustic soda. You"
6Lb8PCw6vcc--51,You will also need a few test tubes and a dropper.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--52,Try these tests on cooked food items as well as raw materials.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--53,Table 2.2 shows you a way to record the observations from these tests.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--54,Some food items are given in this table. You can contact the tests either with these or any other available food items.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--55,Do these tests carefully and do not try to eat or taste any chemicals.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--56," If the required solutions are not available in the readymade form, your teacher can prepare them as given in the box."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--57,Let us begin by testing different food items to see if they contain carbohydrates.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--58,There are many types of carbohydrates.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--59,The main carbohydrates found in our food
6Lb8PCw6vcc--60,are in the form of starch and sugars.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--61,We can easily test if a food item contains starch.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--62," Now, here are some tips are given in the box."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--63,A dilute solution of iodine can be prepared by adding a few drops of tincture iodine to a test tube half filled with water.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--64,Copper sulfate solution can be prepared by dissolving 2 grams of copper sulfate in 100 milliliters of water.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--65,10 grams of caustic soda dissolved in 100 ml of water makes the required solution of caustic soda.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--66,Activity 2
6Lb8PCw6vcc--67,Test for starch
6Lb8PCw6vcc--68,Take a small quantity of a food item or a raw ingredient.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--69,Put 2-3 jobs of dilute iodine solution on it.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--70,as shown in figure 2.1.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--71,Observe if there is any change in the color of the food item.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--72,Did it turn blue black? Here is a figure is given.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--73,Figure 2.1 testing for starch.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--74,Page 10
6Lb8PCw6vcc--75,A blue-black color indicates that it contains...
6Lb8PCw6vcc--76,starch
6Lb8PCw6vcc--77,Repeat this test with other food items to find out which of these contain starch.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--78,Enter all your observations in table 2.2.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--79,Test for protein
6Lb8PCw6vcc--80,Take a small quantity of a food item for testing.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--82," If the food you want to test is a solid, you first need to make a paste of it or powder it."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--83,Grind or mash a small quantity of the food item.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--84," Put some of this in a clean test tube, add 10 drops of water to it and shake the test tube."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--85," Now, using a dropper, add 2 drops of solution of copper sulphate and 10 drops of solution of caustic soda to the test tube."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--86,Figure 2.2
6Lb8PCw6vcc--87,Shake well and let the test tube stand for a few minutes. What do you see?
6Lb8PCw6vcc--88,Did the contents of the test tube turn violet?
6Lb8PCw6vcc--89,A violet color indicates presence of proteins in the food item.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--90,Now you can repeat this test on other food items.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--91,Table 2.2
6Lb8PCw6vcc--92,Nutrients present in some four items.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--93,There are 4 columns are given in this table.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--94,"Food item, starch present"
6Lb8PCw6vcc--95,Protein present
6Lb8PCw6vcc--96,Fat present
6Lb8PCw6vcc--97," Food item, raw potato"
6Lb8PCw6vcc--98,Starch is present
6Lb8PCw6vcc--99,Food item milk
6Lb8PCw6vcc--100,Protein is present
6Lb8PCw6vcc--101,Food item Groundnut
6Lb8PCw6vcc--102,Fat is present.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--103,Now these food items are left for you to conduct
6Lb8PCw6vcc--104,the test and record the observations. The food items are...
6Lb8PCw6vcc--105,Uncooked powdered rice
6Lb8PCw6vcc--106,cooked rice
6Lb8PCw6vcc--107,Dry Coconut
6Lb8PCw6vcc--108,Uncooked tuar daal
6Lb8PCw6vcc--110,cooked daal
6Lb8PCw6vcc--111,a slice of any vegetable
6Lb8PCw6vcc--112,A slice of any fruit.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--113,Boiled egg white portion
6Lb8PCw6vcc--114,Page 11
6Lb8PCw6vcc--115,test for fats
6Lb8PCw6vcc--116,Take a small quantity of a food item.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--117,Wrap it in a piece of paper and crush it.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--118,Take care that the paper does not tear.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--119,Now straighten the paper and observe it carefully.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--120,Does it have an oily patch?
6Lb8PCw6vcc--121,Hold the paper against light.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--122,Are you able to see the light faintly through this patch?
6Lb8PCw6vcc--124,An oily patch on paper shows that the food item contains fat.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--125,The food items may sometimes contain a little water.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--126," Therefore, after you have rubbed an item on paper, let the paper dry for a while."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--127," If there were any water that may have come from food, it would dry up after some time. If no oily patch..."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--128," shows up after this, the food-item does not contain any fat."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--129,What do these tests show?
6Lb8PCw6vcc--130," Are fats, proteins and starch present in all the food items that you tested?"
6Lb8PCw6vcc--131,Does a food item contain more than one nutrient?
6Lb8PCw6vcc--132,Do you find any 4 item that does not contain any of these nutrients?
6Lb8PCw6vcc--133," We tested food items for three nutrients, carbohydrates, proteins and fats."
6Lb8PCw6vcc--134,There are also other nutrients like
6Lb8PCw6vcc--135,vitamins and minerals.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--136,that are present in different food items.
6Lb8PCw6vcc--137,Why do we need all these nutrients?
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--1,Class 5 entitled
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--2,Math magic 5
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--3,Chapter 14
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--4,Page 187
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--6,How big! How heavy!
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--8,Sarika
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--9,Collects things like marbles?
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--10," coins, erasers etc."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--11,She takes some water in a glass and marks the level of water as zero.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--12,There is a picture below on the page in which we can see Sarika interacting with a boy.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--13,She has a glass of water on a table before her.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--14,and she has marked the level of water as zero with a pen. Sarika says
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--15,If I drop 5 marbles in this glass.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--16,Can you guess what will be the level of water? The boy says...
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--17," I think this much, as he points his finger towards a level in the glass."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--18,She drops 5 marbles in the glass.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--19,She marks the new level of water as...
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--20,5 marbles. She says
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--21," Oh, how did you guess?"
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--22,Do you know the volume of a marble?
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--23,the boy replies
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--24,I just made a guess about how much water will be pushed up by the marbles.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--25,How do you find the volume?
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--26,Sarika tells him
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--27," See, each marble pushes up some water, right?"
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--28," That is because it takes up some space, which is its volume."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--30,For the teacher
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--31,Children will need more exercises to compare the volume of solid bodies by guessing and by informal measurement.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--32," that is using marbles, coins,"
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--33,Matchboxes etc. before they begin to use formal measures.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--34,such as litres and cubic centimeters. Page 188
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--35,Your measuring glass
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--36," Now, make a guess."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--37,Do you think the volume of 10 5 rupee coins will be more than that of 10 marbles?
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--39,Guess the volume of each of these.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--40,A ball is nearly...
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--41,dash marbles
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--42,An Eraser is nearly...
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--43,dash marbles. A lemon is nearly
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--44,dash mobiles.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--45,A pencil is nearly dash marbles.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--46,A potato is nearly...
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--47,dash marbles
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--48,On the right side of the page we see the picture of a measuring glass.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--49,We see the markings on the glass from 0 to 35 in intervals of 5.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--50,Now make your own measuring glass using 35 marbles.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--51,Take a glass of water and mark the level of water as zero.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--52,Then put in 5 marbles and mark the level of water as 5 M.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--53," Again, drop 5 marbles."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--54,and mark the level of water as 10.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--55,m. Likewise.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--56,Make the markings for...
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--57,15M
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--58,20m
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--59,25m
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--60,30m
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--61,and 35m.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--63,Now put each thing in the measuring glass and check your guess.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--65," Try with different things like a matchbox, a stone etc and fill the table."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--66,Sarika and the boy still exploring joy by using this measuring glass.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--67," After putting the matchbox inside it, Sarekai is saying,"
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--68,The matchbox floats. How do I find its volume? The boy replies.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--69,Let's fill it with sand or nails.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--71,On the side of the page we have a table with two columns.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--72,Column 1 heading is Name of the Thing.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--73,Column 2 heading is its volume.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--74," That is, nearly how many marbles."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--76,Rest of the table is blind for you to fill in. For the teacher
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--77,Children can paste up the
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--78,paper strip on the glass and mark the level of water using a pen or a pencil.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--79,The aim is to develop a sense of the concept of volume through examples and hands on activities without giving a definition of volume.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--80,Comparing things on the basis of volume is more abstract.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--81,then comparison in terms of length or area.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--82,page 190
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--84,which has more volume.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--86,We have the picture of Sariqa and the boy again on this page.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--87,Sorry guys asking the boy.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--88,Can you tell me the volume of 6 marbles in milliliters?
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--89," The boy says, yes, if we make a measuring bottle."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--90," On the table before them, six marbles are lying."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--92,In class 4 you made a measuring bottle for 250 ml.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--93,Can you think of ways for making a measuring bottle which can measure 10 milliliters?
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--94," 21 milliliters, 30 milliliters"
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--95,all the way up to 16 ml?
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--96,Discuss with your friend.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--97,Tariq and Mollim.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--98,Made their measuring bottles. Tariq Had An Injection
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--100,He used it to make his measuring bottle.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--101,Molly used an empty medicine bottle.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--103,On the right side of the page we have the pictures of Tarek's injection and Mollie's empty medicine bottle.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--104,Tarek is telling Molly?
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--106,I took 5 ml once in my injection.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--107,I filled it twice to mark 10 milliliters on my bottle.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--108,to which Molly replies.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--109,I used this bottle which measures 10 milliliters to make my measuring bottle.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--111," In the picture below, Tarek and Molly are using their own bottles."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--113,Molly used her measuring bottle to find the volume of 5 rupee coins.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--114,She found that 9 5 rupee coins push up 10 milliliters of water.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--115,So you can also use 9 5 rupee coins to make your measuring bottle.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--116,Go ahead.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--117,Use your measuring bottle to find out.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--118,A
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--119,What is the volume of 6 smables?
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--120,dash milliliters
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--121,"page 190, b"
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--122,What is the volume of 16 1 rupee coins? Dash milliliters
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--124,Now solve these in your mind.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--125,C
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--126,The volume of 24 marbles is dash milliliters.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--128,D
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--129,the volume of 32 1 rupee coins
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--130,dash milliliters Y
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--131,Molly puts some 5 rupee coins in the measuring bottle.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--132,How many coins has she put in it?
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--133,If 30 ml water is pushed up.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--134,dash
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--135," If 60 ml water is pushed up, dash."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--137,First guess and then use your measuring bottle to find out the volume in milliliters of some other things.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--138,There's a table below with two columns. column one for thing
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--139,Column
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--140,to 4 its volume in milliliters.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--141,An interesting question.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--142,Guess how many liters of water your body will push up?
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--143,How many can fit in?
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--145,We see a girl holding a small cube in her hand.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--146,it's a cube whose sides are 1 cm each.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--147," cube itself is also shown in one of the pictures. This is a cube whose sides are of 1 cm each. See, your math magic book is 1 cm high, so guess..."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--148,How many such centimeter cubes will take? The same space?
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--149,as your math magic book. For the teacher
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--151," To make a measuring bottle, make children use a wide mouth and transparent bottle."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--152,so that markings can be made easily.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--153,The activity aims to develop measurement skills in children and involves both making and handling apparatus. It
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--154,as measuring bottle in the mathematics classroom.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--155,Page 191.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--157,There's a picture of some students who are all busy measuring things and are talking to each other.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--158,The first one says...
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--159," Hey, my math magic book is about......dash centimeters long."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--160," So, dash, centimeter cubes will fit along its length."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--161,The second boy says...
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--162,So total dash centimeter cubes will fit on the Math Magic book.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--163,One girl replies from the other corner.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--164,and it is about dash centimeters wide.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--165,So dash cubes will fit along the width.
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--166," Now, if all these cubes are arranged in one line."
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--167,Then how long will that line be dash centimeters
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--168,Practice Time
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--170,1
NwVF-WWZ0Bc--171,A stage or platform is made with 5 math magic books.

_SSJde7GrTA--157,Chegu was happy.
_SSJde7GrTA--158,It took 100 meters of wire and tried to make different rectangles.
_SSJde7GrTA--159,He made a 10 meter by 40 meter rectangle.
_SSJde7GrTA--160,Its area was 400 square meters.
_SSJde7GrTA--161,So he next made a 30 meter by 20 meter rectangle.
_SSJde7GrTA--162,You
_SSJde7GrTA--163,What is its area?
_SSJde7GrTA--164,Is it more than the first rectangle?
_SSJde7GrTA--165,What other rectangles can he make with 100 meters of wire?
_SSJde7GrTA--166,Discuss which of these rectangles will have the biggest area.
_SSJde7GrTA--167,Chego's wife asked him to make a circle with the wire.
_SSJde7GrTA--168,She knew it had an area of 800 square meters.
_SSJde7GrTA--169," Now after realizing this, Chego is telling her..."
_SSJde7GrTA--170," Ha, I want this piece of land. It covers an area of 800 square meters."

_SSJde7GrTA--176," Okay, Chegu has taken 800 square meters of land, honor?"
_SSJde7GrTA--177," Now I will give you as much gold wire, which can make a boundary for land."
_SSJde7GrTA--178,with area 800 square meters.
_SSJde7GrTA--179,page 158.
_SSJde7GrTA--180," So, Hunner also tried many different ways to make a boundary for 800 square meters of land."
_SSJde7GrTA--181,To want the right side of the page we see a picture of Anor trying his luck in making the boundary for land with area 800 square meters.
_SSJde7GrTA--182," He made rectangles A, B and C of different sizes."
_SSJde7GrTA--183,Find out the length of the boundary of each.
_SSJde7GrTA--184,How much gold wire will he get for these rectangles?
_SSJde7GrTA--186,Retangle A.
_SSJde7GrTA--187,40m x 20m
_SSJde7GrTA--188,Gold wire for A is equal to dash meters.

_SSJde7GrTA--198,Rectangle D
_SSJde7GrTA--199,8000m by 0.1m.
_SSJde7GrTA--200," So, he will get..."
_SSJde7GrTA--201,Dash meters of gold wire.
_SSJde7GrTA--202," When the king heard this, his reaction was..."
_SSJde7GrTA--203,Gosh! How can I give you so much gold?
_SSJde7GrTA--204,Now do you understand why the King fainted?
_SSJde7GrTA--205,On the bottom right of the page we again have the wise bird asking us.
_SSJde7GrTA--206,Can you make a rectangle with a still longer boundary?
_SSJde7GrTA--207," I made a rectangle 1cm wide and 80,000 meters long."
_SSJde7GrTA--208,Imagine how long that boundary will be.
_SSJde7GrTA--209,With that much gold wire

9KVSNmWtqvA--2,Magic 6
9KVSNmWtqvA--3,This is the chapter 9.
9KVSNmWtqvA--4,From page 126 to page 133.
9KVSNmWtqvA--5,Page 126.
9KVSNmWtqvA--6,boxes and sketches.
9KVSNmWtqvA--7,Sweet box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--8,Romeo went to buy sweets.
9KVSNmWtqvA--9,The shopkeeper took a paper cut out and quickly made a lovely pink box for the Swedes.
9KVSNmWtqvA--10,Observe the photo and make your own box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--11,Use the cutout on page 201.
9KVSNmWtqvA--12,How fast can you fold it?
9KVSNmWtqvA--13,To the right side of the page we see a picture of the box that was made by the shopkeeper by the paper cut out in pink color. After coming home...
9KVSNmWtqvA--14,Ramiya unfolded the box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--15,She removed the extra flaps so the cutout looked like this.
9KVSNmWtqvA--16,There is a picture of the box unfolded given below this.
9KVSNmWtqvA--17,and to the right side of that we have Ramea thinking in her mind.
9KVSNmWtqvA--18,This shape makes a box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--19,Let me see what other shapes will make a box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--20,She made four more shapes.
9KVSNmWtqvA--21,Each is to be folded along the dotted lines.
9KVSNmWtqvA--22,You have to find out which of these can be made into a box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--23,We have four different cutouts below this.
9KVSNmWtqvA--24," marked as A, B, C and D."
9KVSNmWtqvA--25,Each has some dotted lines and is supposed to be folded along those lines.
9KVSNmWtqvA--26,and also you have to find out which of these boxes can actually be made into a box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--27,for the teacher.
9KVSNmWtqvA--28,This chapter focuses on visualization of three dimensional shapes.
9KVSNmWtqvA--29,and how they can be represented on paper.
9KVSNmWtqvA--30,in two dimensions.
9KVSNmWtqvA--31,The representation used here are Nets.
9KVSNmWtqvA--32,like the ones above.
9KVSNmWtqvA--33,Layout plans for a house and perspective drawings.
9KVSNmWtqvA--34,Page 128
9KVSNmWtqvA--35,shapes that fold into a cube.
9KVSNmWtqvA--36,Hey.
9KVSNmWtqvA--37,Buddha wants to make a paper cube using a square sheet.
9KVSNmWtqvA--38,He knows that all the faces of a cube are squares.
9KVSNmWtqvA--39," To the right side of the page on the top we have a picture of Buddha, thinking and asking himself."
9KVSNmWtqvA--40,How many faces does the cube have?
9KVSNmWtqvA--41,in his mind he's seeing a cube.
9KVSNmWtqvA--42,He draws two different shapes.
9KVSNmWtqvA--43,Below this we have a square grid.
9KVSNmWtqvA--44,on which two different shapes drawn by Buddha can be seen. One is in blue colour.
9KVSNmWtqvA--45,the other one in yellow. Questions?
9KVSNmWtqvA--46,Will both these shapes fold into a cube?
9KVSNmWtqvA--47,Draw at least one more shape which can fold into a cube.
9KVSNmWtqvA--49,What will be the area of each face of the cube?
9KVSNmWtqvA--51,Draw one shape which will not fold into a cube.
9KVSNmWtqvA--52,Look around and discuss which things around you look like a cube.
9KVSNmWtqvA--54,List a few. Shades.
9KVSNmWtqvA--55,for an open box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--56,Remember the puzzles with 5 squares in Chapter 3?
9KVSNmWtqvA--57,You saw 12 different shapes made with 5 squares.
9KVSNmWtqvA--58,page 46.
9KVSNmWtqvA--59,If you cut those shapes and fold them...
9KVSNmWtqvA--60,Some of those will fold into an open box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--61,There is a box without a top.
9KVSNmWtqvA--62,Page 128.
9KVSNmWtqvA--63,On the top of the page we have a picture of a girl.
9KVSNmWtqvA--64,with a box
9KVSNmWtqvA--65,thinking and talking to us. She tells us
9KVSNmWtqvA--66,I can make open boxes with both these.
9KVSNmWtqvA--67,But with these I cannot make open boxes.
9KVSNmWtqvA--68,she's pointing to two different groups of shapes.
9KVSNmWtqvA--69,which can be folded and made into an open box. Question
9KVSNmWtqvA--70,Find out which of the other 8 shapes. On page 46.
9KVSNmWtqvA--71,can be folded to make an open box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--73,Draw more shapes which will not fold to make an open box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--74,boxes and boxes.
9KVSNmWtqvA--75,All boxes are not cubes.
9KVSNmWtqvA--76,Here are some different kinds of boxes.
9KVSNmWtqvA--77,Match the shape on the left with a box into which...
9KVSNmWtqvA--78,it will fold.
9KVSNmWtqvA--79,We have two different pictures.
9KVSNmWtqvA--80,The first picture shows us some different kinds of boxes and the second one is...
9KVSNmWtqvA--81,a group of some shapes into which
9KVSNmWtqvA--82,Those boxes may or may not fold.
9KVSNmWtqvA--83,for the teacher.
9KVSNmWtqvA--84,Making mental images of shapes is an important mathematical ability.
9KVSNmWtqvA--85,Children will need many exercises to visualize the net of a box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--86,to think of how it looks when flattened.
9KVSNmWtqvA--87,and also to check which nets.
9KVSNmWtqvA--88,Like those on page 126.
9KVSNmWtqvA--89,Do not make a box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--90,Page 129.
9KVSNmWtqvA--91,Floor maps.
9KVSNmWtqvA--92," For making a house, a floor map is first made."
9KVSNmWtqvA--93,Have you ever seen a floor map?
9KVSNmWtqvA--94,Here is a floor map of the Bans house.
9KVSNmWtqvA--95,It shows where the windows and the doors are in the house.
9KVSNmWtqvA--96,On the left we have the floor map of Vibhasaos indicating the doors and windows clearly.
9KVSNmWtqvA--97,Question
9KVSNmWtqvA--98,which is the front side of her house.
9KVSNmWtqvA--99,How many windows are there on the front side?
9KVSNmWtqvA--100," From the flow map, we cannot make out what her house really looks like."
9KVSNmWtqvA--101," Oh, how high the windows are. So"
9KVSNmWtqvA--102,We look for a special way of drawing the house.
9KVSNmWtqvA--103,which is deep. To show the length
9KVSNmWtqvA--104,width and height.
9KVSNmWtqvA--105,Here are four deep drawings of houses.
9KVSNmWtqvA--106,We can see four deep drawings around the question.
9KVSNmWtqvA--107," A, B, C and D."
9KVSNmWtqvA--108,You have to find out?
9KVSNmWtqvA--109,Which one is Vibhans house?
9KVSNmWtqvA--110,Why do the other 3D drawings not match the floor map?
9KVSNmWtqvA--111,discuss.
9KVSNmWtqvA--112,For the Teacher
9KVSNmWtqvA--113,A three-dimensional perspective drawing has been called a deep drawing.
9KVSNmWtqvA--114,So that children get a sense of the need to represent depth.
9KVSNmWtqvA--115,They should be able to see the difference between deep drawings and layout plans.
9KVSNmWtqvA--117,page 130.
9KVSNmWtqvA--118,practice time 1.
9KVSNmWtqvA--119,Observe this floor map of a house.
9KVSNmWtqvA--121,Make doors and windows on the deep drawing of this house.
9KVSNmWtqvA--122,Below this we have the floor map of a house which indicates the doors and windows.
9KVSNmWtqvA--123,And to the next we have a deep drawing of the house.
9KVSNmWtqvA--124,You have to make the doors and windows accordingly.
9KVSNmWtqvA--125,Are there any windows you couldn't show on the deep drawing? Circle them on the floor map.
9KVSNmWtqvA--126,2
9KVSNmWtqvA--127,Try to make a floor map of your own house. A deep drawing of a cube.
9KVSNmWtqvA--129,Sumitro and his friends made deep drawings of a cube.
9KVSNmWtqvA--130,These are their drawings.
9KVSNmWtqvA--131,We have seven different drawings of the cube made by Sumitro and his friends. These have been marked as...
9KVSNmWtqvA--132,A B C D E
9KVSNmWtqvA--133,F and G. Which of the drawings look like?
9KVSNmWtqvA--134,Correct to you?
9KVSNmWtqvA--135,discuss.
9KVSNmWtqvA--136,Can you add some lines to make drawing F into a deep drawing of the cube?
9KVSNmWtqvA--137,Page 131.
9KVSNmWtqvA--138,Puzzle
9KVSNmWtqvA--139,This cutout is folded to make a cube.
9KVSNmWtqvA--140," There is a cutout before us, which, when folded,"
9KVSNmWtqvA--141,can be turned into a cube. Question
9KVSNmWtqvA--142,Which of these are the correct deep drawings of that cube? Hey!
9KVSNmWtqvA--143," B, C, D, E"
9KVSNmWtqvA--144,6 different options are there for you.
9KVSNmWtqvA--145,to observe and answer correctly.
9KVSNmWtqvA--146,a simple way to draw a cube.
9KVSNmWtqvA--147,You
9KVSNmWtqvA--148,Chanda wants to make a deep drawing of this cube.
9KVSNmWtqvA--149,We can see a red coloured cube.
9KVSNmWtqvA--150,to the side of this question.
9KVSNmWtqvA--151,She draws the cube like this.
9KVSNmWtqvA--152,Below this we have a picture in which Chandaise explaining how she drew this deep drawing of the cube.
9KVSNmWtqvA--153,I drew two squares like this.
9KVSNmWtqvA--154,to show the front face and the back face.
9KVSNmWtqvA--155," We see two squares drawn, a little diagonally to each other."
9KVSNmWtqvA--156,I joined the corners of the squares like this to make the deep drawing of the box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--157," in a simple but effective way, joining the corners of the squares."
9KVSNmWtqvA--158,turns this drawing into a deep drawing of the cube or the box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--159," In the same way, make a deep drawing of a box which looks like this."
9KVSNmWtqvA--160,We can see a rectangular box.
9KVSNmWtqvA--161,for which you have to make a deep drawing.
9KVSNmWtqvA--163,for the teacher.
9KVSNmWtqvA--164,The 2D representation of 3D objects is a matter of convention.
9KVSNmWtqvA--165,and is learnt by children through experience.
9KVSNmWtqvA--166," Here, the conventional way of drawing the cube is given."

9KVSNmWtqvA--173," Below the question, we have a picture of the bridge made by Matchboxes."
9KVSNmWtqvA--174," We also see the faces of Navin, Bhaskar and Pratigya around the bridge."
9KVSNmWtqvA--175,Navin and Pratigam made drawings of the bridge. Navin is saying...
9KVSNmWtqvA--176,The bridge looks like this to me from where I am standing.
9KVSNmWtqvA--177,and we can note how his perspective looks like.
9KVSNmWtqvA--178," to this, Pratig Gyan says."
9KVSNmWtqvA--179,The bridge looks like this to me.
9KVSNmWtqvA--180,My drawing shows how high our bridges
9KVSNmWtqvA--181,and how wide it is.
9KVSNmWtqvA--182,Now we see things from the perspective of Prithigya.
9KVSNmWtqvA--183,and what we see is represented in a box in front of her.
9KVSNmWtqvA--184,to this Bhaskar size.
9KVSNmWtqvA--185,From your drawing I can make out how long and how high the bridge is.
9KVSNmWtqvA--186,But I cannot make out how wide it is.
9KVSNmWtqvA--187,Page 133. If you look at the bridge from the top.
9KVSNmWtqvA--188,How will it look?
9KVSNmWtqvA--189,Choose the right drawing below.
9KVSNmWtqvA--190,We have two different options A and B to choose from.
9KVSNmWtqvA--191,Think and then answer.

6dvgNioTESo--21,Life is dear.
6dvgNioTESo--22,ordinary people could understand the teachings of Mahavir.

6dvgNioTESo--24,Prakrit
6dvgNioTESo--25,There were several forms of Prakrit used in different
6dvgNioTESo--26,parts of the country.
6dvgNioTESo--27,and named after the regions in which they were used.

6dvgNioTESo--38,It was very difficult for most men and women.
6dvgNioTESo--39,to follow these strict rules.
6dvgNioTESo--40," Nevertheless, thousands"
6dvgNioTESo--41,left their homes to learn and teach.
6dvgNioTESo--42,this new way of life.
6dvgNioTESo--43,Many more remained behind.
6dvgNioTESo--44,and supported those who became monks.
6dvgNioTESo--45,and nuns providing them with food.
6dvgNioTESo--46,Genism was supported mainly by traders.

6dvgNioTESo--66,an association of those who left their homes.
6dvgNioTESo--67,The rules made for the Buddhist Sang.
6dvgNioTESo--69,were written down in a book called Vinay Pitak. From this we know...
6dvgNioTESo--70,that there were separate branches for men and women.

6dvgNioTESo--79,and went to cities and villages to beg for food during fixed
6dvgNioTESo--80,hours

6dvgNioTESo--110,Then their supporters built temporary shelters for them in gardens.
6dvgNioTESo--111,or they lived in natural caves in hilly areas. As time went on.
6dvgNioTESo--112," many supporters of the monks and nuns, and they themselves."

RDxX3fWFvzY--6,Page 46.
RDxX3fWFvzY--7,What a fun would it be if you sir
RDxX3fWFvzY--8,suddenly get some magical powers to change things around you.
RDxX3fWFvzY--9,What are the things you would want to change?
RDxX3fWFvzY--10," We do not have magical powers of course, but we can still change"
RDxX3fWFvzY--11,a few things around us.
RDxX3fWFvzY--12,Perhaps many things.
RDxX3fWFvzY--13,Can you list a few things you can change around you?
RDxX3fWFvzY--14,With no magic involved?
RDxX3fWFvzY--15," Many changes are taking place around us on their own. In the fields,"
RDxX3fWFvzY--16,The crops change from time to time.
RDxX3fWFvzY--17," Sometimes leaves fall from trees, change colour and dry out."
RDxX3fWFvzY--18," The flowers bloom and then, wither away."

RDxX3fWFvzY--22,and your weight increases as you grow.
RDxX3fWFvzY--23,Did you realize earlier that so many changes are taking place?
RDxX3fWFvzY--24,around you all the time?
RDxX3fWFvzY--25,Can some of the changes be grouped together?
RDxX3fWFvzY--26,How can we group various changes?
RDxX3fWFvzY--27,It might help if we find some similarities between them.
RDxX3fWFvzY--28,6.1
RDxX3fWFvzY--29,Can all changes always be reversed?
RDxX3fWFvzY--30,Activity 2
RDxX3fWFvzY--31,Take a balloon and blow it.
RDxX3fWFvzY--32,Take care that it does not burst. The shape and size of the balloon have changed. Figure 6.2
RDxX3fWFvzY--33," Now, let the air escape the balloon."
RDxX3fWFvzY--34,Figure 6.1 shows a balloon changes its size and shape on blowing air into it.
RDxX3fWFvzY--35,Activity 3
RDxX3fWFvzY--36,Take a piece of paper and fold it as shown in figure 6.2. You have changed the sheet of paper into a toy airplane. You may have lots of fun in flying this plane.
RDxX3fWFvzY--37,Once you are tired of it unfold the paper again.
RDxX3fWFvzY--38,Page 48
RDxX3fWFvzY--39,Activity 4
RDxX3fWFvzY--40,Take some dough and make a ball.
RDxX3fWFvzY--41,Try to roll out a roti.
RDxX3fWFvzY--42,Maybe you are not happy with its shape and wish to change it back into a ball of dough again.
RDxX3fWFvzY--43," Now think about the three changes you observed in activity 1, 2 and 3."
RDxX3fWFvzY--44,What do they have in common? Was it possible to get the balloon back to its original shape and size?
RDxX3fWFvzY--46,Was the size of the paper same as before and after making an aeroplane?
RDxX3fWFvzY--47,Was it possible to get back the ball of dough again?
RDxX3fWFvzY--48,What do you conclude?
RDxX3fWFvzY--49," In each of the three activities, is it possible to get back to the material with which we started our activity?"
RDxX3fWFvzY--50," If the answer is yes,"
RDxX3fWFvzY--51,It means that the changes occurring in these activities can be reversed. Now
RDxX3fWFvzY--52,Let us repeat the same activities with a difference.
RDxX3fWFvzY--53,Activity 5
RDxX3fWFvzY--54,Take the same balloon which you used in Activity 1.
RDxX3fWFvzY--55,Blow it to its full size and tie its mouth with a string tightly. Break it with the pointed tip of your pencil.
RDxX3fWFvzY--56," Oops, it burst."
RDxX3fWFvzY--57,Activity 6
RDxX3fWFvzY--58,Take the same piece of paper which you used in Activity 2.
RDxX3fWFvzY--59,Draw an aeroplane on it and cut along its outline.
RDxX3fWFvzY--60,Activity 7
RDxX3fWFvzY--61,Roll out a roti from the ball of dough again and bake it on a tawa.
RDxX3fWFvzY--62,Suppose you are asked the same three questions which you answered after Activity 3.
RDxX3fWFvzY--63,What would your answers be now?
RDxX3fWFvzY--64,We see that the changes which have occurred in the activity 456 cannot be reversed.
RDxX3fWFvzY--65," You use a pencil and an eraser. With repeated use, their shape and size change. Can we reverse this change?"

RDxX3fWFvzY--103,6.2
RDxX3fWFvzY--104,Could there be other ways to bring a change?
RDxX3fWFvzY--105,We all have seen the tools which are used to dig the soil.
RDxX3fWFvzY--106,Have you ever seen how the RN blade in these tools is fixed to the wooden handle?
RDxX3fWFvzY--107,The iron blade of these tools has a ring in which the wooden handle is fixed.
RDxX3fWFvzY--108," Normally, the ring is slightly smaller in size than the wooden handle. To fix."
RDxX3fWFvzY--109," the handle, the ring is heated and it becomes slightly larger in size."
RDxX3fWFvzY--110,Actually it expands.
RDxX3fWFvzY--111," Now the handle easily fits into the ring. When the ring cools down, it contracts and fits tightly onto the handle."
RDxX3fWFvzY--112,Such a change is also used for fixing the metal rim on a wooden wheel of a cart as shown in figure 6.8
RDxX3fWFvzY--113," Again, the metal rim is made slightly smaller than the wooden wheel."
RDxX3fWFvzY--114,On heating the rim expands and fits onto the wheel.
RDxX3fWFvzY--115,Cold water is then poured over the rim.
RDxX3fWFvzY--116,which contracts and fits tightly onto the wheel.
RDxX3fWFvzY--117,page 50
RDxX3fWFvzY--118," When we heat water in a pan, it begins to boil after some time."
RDxX3fWFvzY--119," If we continue to heat further, the quantity of water in the pan begins to decrease."
RDxX3fWFvzY--120,The water changes into its vapor.
RDxX3fWFvzY--121," In Activity 7 Chapter 5, you have observed."
RDxX3fWFvzY--122,that water vapor gets changed into liquid water when it is cooled. We all have noticed melting of eyes.
RDxX3fWFvzY--123,Ice melts when it is heated.
RDxX3fWFvzY--124,What does it change into?
RDxX3fWFvzY--125,Is it possible to change this water back into eyes?
RDxX3fWFvzY--126,Let us observe some more changes.

RDxX3fWFvzY--133,If you have ever seen a blacksmith making some tools?
RDxX3fWFvzY--134,How does a blacksmith change a piece of iron into different tools?
RDxX3fWFvzY--135,A piece of iron is heated.
RDxX3fWFvzY--136,Till it becomes red hot.
RDxX3fWFvzY--137,It then becomes soft and is beaten into a desired shape.
RDxX3fWFvzY--138,What change has taken place in iron on being heated?
RDxX3fWFvzY--139,Activity 8
RDxX3fWFvzY--140,Take a small candle and measure its length with a scale.
RDxX3fWFvzY--141,Now fix it at a suitable place and light it.
RDxX3fWFvzY--142,Let it burn for some time.
RDxX3fWFvzY--143," Now, blow out the candle and measure its length again."
RDxX3fWFvzY--144,Figure 6.8. Can the change in the length of the candle be reversed?
RDxX3fWFvzY--145," If we were to take some wax in a pan and heat it, can this change pretty worse?"

RDxX3fWFvzY--147,Repeat activity 7 with an incense stick.
RDxX3fWFvzY--148,Wait till it burns away completely.
RDxX3fWFvzY--149,What are the changes that occur in the insensistic?
RDxX3fWFvzY--150,The stick burns to produce some new material.
RDxX3fWFvzY--151,These are Ash and some guesses.
RDxX3fWFvzY--152,We cannot see these gases but can sense them.

RDxX3fWFvzY--154,Can this change be reversed?
RDxX3fWFvzY--155,And what about the change which occurred in the matte stick you use for lighting the candle or incense stick?
RDxX3fWFvzY--156,So far we have discussed the changes.
RDxX3fWFvzY--157,occurring in a given object or its material.
RDxX3fWFvzY--158,What about the changes that occur when two substances are mixed together?
RDxX3fWFvzY--159,In Chapter 5
RDxX3fWFvzY--160,We dissolved salt in water
RDxX3fWFvzY--161,Do you think a change occurred in salt or in water?
RDxX3fWFvzY--162,Is it possible to reverse this change?
RDxX3fWFvzY--164," Wait, in chapter 5 we learnt how to separate salt from its solution in water."
RDxX3fWFvzY--165," So, can we say that the change due to dissolving salt in water be reversed?"
RDxX3fWFvzY--166," Pahili asks, if you have ever seen curd being set, a small quantity of curd is added to warm milk. The milk is stirred and is set aside for a few hours at a warm place."
RDxX3fWFvzY--167," few hours, the milk changes into curd."
RDxX3fWFvzY--168,You
RDxX3fWFvzY--169,Can this change be reversed?
RDxX3fWFvzY--170," We find that a few ways to bring about a change in a substance could be by heating it or by mixing it with some other substance. We also find that some changes can be reversed while some others cannot be reversed. There must be many other ways of changing things around us. It is possible that some of them could be reversed. Thus, changes around us could be grouped as those that can be reversed or cannot be reversed. In higher classes, you will learn more about the ways in which changes can be made and the way these can be grouped."

wy_iZz_Y0xM--4,Earthworm
wy_iZz_Y0xM--5,Activity 5
wy_iZz_Y0xM--6,Observe an earthworm moving on soil in a garden.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--7,Gently lift it and place it on a piece of blotting or filter paper.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--8,Observe its movement.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--9,Figure 8.18
wy_iZz_Y0xM--10,Then place it on a smooth glass plate or any slippery surface.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--11,Observe its movement now.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--12,Is it different from that on paper?
wy_iZz_Y0xM--13,In which of the above two surfaces?
wy_iZz_Y0xM--14,Do you find that the earthworm is able to move easily?
wy_iZz_Y0xM--15,The body of an earthworm is made up of many rings joined end to end.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--16,An earthworm does not have bones.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--17,It has muscles which help to extend and shorten the body.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--18," During movement, the earthworm first extends the front part of the body."
wy_iZz_Y0xM--19,Keeping the rear portion fixed to the ground.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--21,Then it fixes the front end and releases the rear end.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--22,It then shortens the body and pulls the rear end forward.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--23,This makes it move forward by a small distance.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--24," Repeating such muscle expansions and contractions, the earthworm can move through soil."
wy_iZz_Y0xM--25,Its body secrets are slimy substance to help the movement.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--26,Figure 8.18 shows movement of
wy_iZz_Y0xM--27,earthworm
wy_iZz_Y0xM--28,How does it fix parts of its body to the ground?
wy_iZz_Y0xM--29," Under its body, it has a large number of tiny bristles."
wy_iZz_Y0xM--30,Hair-like structures projecting out.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--31,The bristles are connected with muscles.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--32,The bristles help to get a good grip on the ground.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--33,The earthworm actually eats its way through the soil.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--34,Its body then shows away the undigested part of the material that it eats.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--35,This activity of an earthworm makes the soil more useful for plants.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--36,Snail
wy_iZz_Y0xM--37,Activity 7
wy_iZz_Y0xM--38,Observe a snail in your garden or in the field.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--39,Have you seen the rounded structure it carries on its back?
wy_iZz_Y0xM--40,Figure 8.20
wy_iZz_Y0xM--41,This is called the shell and it is the outer skeleton of the snail.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--42,but is not made of bones.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--43,The shell is a single unit and does not help in moving from place to place. It has to be dragged along.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--45,Please this nail on a glass plate and watch it.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--46," When it starts moving, carefully lift the glass plate along with the snail over your head."
wy_iZz_Y0xM--47,Observe its movements from beneath.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--48,Figure 8.19 Shows are snail.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--49,Page 75
wy_iZz_Y0xM--50,A thick structure and the head of the snail may come out of an opening in the shell.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--51,The thick structure is its foot made of strong muscles.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--52,Now carefully tilt the glass plate.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--53,The very motion of the foot can be seen.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--54,Is the movement of a snail slow or fast as compared to an earthworm?
wy_iZz_Y0xM--55,Cocruj
wy_iZz_Y0xM--56,Activity 8
wy_iZz_Y0xM--57,Observe a cockroach.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--58,Figure 8.21
wy_iZz_Y0xM--59,Cockroaches walk and climb as well as fly in the air.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--60,They have three pairs of legs.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--61,These help in walking.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--62,The body is covered with a hard outer skeleton.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--63,This outer skeleton is made of number of plates joined together and that permits movement.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--64,There are two pairs of wings attached to the body behind head.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--65,The cockroaches have distinct muscles.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--66,Those near the legs move the legs for walking.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--67,The body muscles move the wings when the cockroach flies.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--68,Figure 8.20 shows a cockroach.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--69,But
wy_iZz_Y0xM--70,Birds fly in the air and walk on the ground.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--71,Some birds like ducks and swans also swim in water.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--72,The birds can fly because their bodies are well suited for flying.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--73,Their bones are hollow and light.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--74,The bones of the hind limbs are typical for walking and perching.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--75,The body parts of the four limbs are modified as wings. The shoulder bones are strong.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--76,The breast bones are modified to hold muscles of flight which are used to move the wings up and down. Figure 8.21 Shoes skeleton of a bird.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--77,Fish.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--78,Activity 7
wy_iZz_Y0xM--79," Make a paper boot, put it in water and push it with one narrow end pointing forward."
wy_iZz_Y0xM--80,Figure 8.22e
wy_iZz_Y0xM--81,Did it go into the water easily?
wy_iZz_Y0xM--82,Now hold the boat sideways and push it into the water from the broad side.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--83,Figure 8.22b
wy_iZz_Y0xM--84,Are you able to make the boat move in water when you push it from the side?
wy_iZz_Y0xM--85,Figure 8.23
wy_iZz_Y0xM--86,Shows playing with boards
wy_iZz_Y0xM--87,page 76
wy_iZz_Y0xM--88," Figure 8.23 shows, fishes."
wy_iZz_Y0xM--90,Have you noticed that the shape of a boat is somewhat like a fish?
wy_iZz_Y0xM--91,FIGA 8.24
wy_iZz_Y0xM--92,The head and tail of the fish are smaller than the middle portion of the body.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--93,The body tapers at both ends.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--94,This body shape is called stream lined.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--95,The shape is such that water can flow around it easily and allow the fish to move in water. The skeleton of the fish is covered with strong muscles.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--96," During swimming, muscles make the front part of the body curve to one side and the tail part swings towards the opposite side."
wy_iZz_Y0xM--97,The fish forms occur as shown in figure 8.24.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--98,Then quickly the body and tail curve to the other side.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--99,This makes a jerk and pushes the body forward.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--100,A series of such jerks make the fish swim ahead
wy_iZz_Y0xM--101,This is helped by the fins of the tails.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--102,Figure 8.24 shows movement in fish.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--103,Fish also have other fins on their body which mainly help to keep the balance of the body and to keep direction while swimming.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--104,Did you ever notice that underwater divers were fill like flippers on their feet to help them move easily in water?
wy_iZz_Y0xM--105,How to snakes move?
wy_iZz_Y0xM--106,Have you seen a snake slither
wy_iZz_Y0xM--107,Does it move straight?
wy_iZz_Y0xM--108,Figure 8.26
wy_iZz_Y0xM--109,Sninks have a long backbone.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--110,They have many thin muscles. They are...
wy_iZz_Y0xM--111,connected to each other.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--112,even though they are far from one another.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--113," Muscles also interconnect the backbone, ribs and skin."
wy_iZz_Y0xM--114,The snake's body curves into many loops.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--115,Each loop of this ray gives it a forward push by pressing against the ground.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--116,Since its slum body makes many loops and each loop gives it this push.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--117,The snake moves forward very fast and not in a straight line.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--118,We have learned about the use of bones and muscles for the movements of different animals.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--119,Paheli and Bujo have many questions in their sacks about the different movements in animals.
wy_iZz_Y0xM--120,So must you be having many unanswered questions buzzing in your mind?
