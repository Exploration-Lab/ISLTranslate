> **Abstract:** *Sign languages are the primary means of communication for a large number of people worldwide. Recently, the availability of Sign language translation datasets have facilitated the
incorporation of Sign language research in the
NLP community. Though a wide variety of
research focuses on improving translation systems for sign language, the lack of ample annotated resources hinders research in the datadriven natural language processing community.
In this resource paper, we introduce ISLTranslate, a translation dataset for continuous Indian Sign Language (ISL), consisting of 30k
ISL-English sentence pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first and largest translation
dataset for continuous Indian Sign Language
with corresponding English transcripts. We
provide a detailed analysis of the dataset and
examine the distribution of words and phrases
covered in the proposed dataset. To validate
the performance of existing end-to-end Sign
language to spoken language translation systems, we benchmark the created dataset with
multiple existing state-of-the-art systems for
sign languages.*






## Download Dataset

The ISLTranslate dataset can be downloaded using the following [ðŸ”— Download Link](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuBOJ2hW9GimgblntP72D_agQdokdQ?e=ZbeA6y). The dataset directory structure is as follows:

## ISL-Signer Validation
To verify the reliability of the video-sentence/phrase ISL-English pairs present in the
dataset, we took the help of a certified ISL signer. Due to the limited availability of certified ISL signers, we could only use a small randomly selected sign-text pairs sample (291 pairs) for human translation and validation.
The comparison set can be found in the [ISL-Signer Validation](./data/ISL-signer_validation.csv) file.
The comparison set contains the following columns:

| uid    | Transcribed Text (text present in ISLTranslate translation dataset)     | Gold Translation (text generated by ISL Singer)
| :-----       | :---              | :-----   
1782bea75c7d-10 | "Birbal started smiling. When it was his turn, he went near the line." |Birbal started smiling. He turned towards the drawn line.
